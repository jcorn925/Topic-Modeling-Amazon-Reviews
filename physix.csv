review
"I purchased this a few weeks ago.  The sleeve constantly rolls down my leg.  I purchased the correct size and align it up properly with my knee cap.  Yesterday I literally had to take it off mid-workout because it’s very frustrating to have to pull and tug on this all workout.  I’m tossing it in the trash today when I get home.,The seller asks you to reach out if not satisfied.  I’ve reached out and it normally takes the seller about two days to respond.  However, it has now been a week and I have not gotten a response from them and the unsatisfying product.  I won’t buy this again.,Yes, there is some compression and it does SLIGHTLY help keep the knee snug. It is like a cotton blend compression sock. By no means is this a 'brace'. I have worn plenty of braces and this is not it. I would buy it again...if it was $9.99, but for the $21.95 I paid, totally not worth it. Why am I not returning it? Because it would cost me too much! I will wear my knee sock to bed to keep my loose knee from moving around too much in my sleep. It might work for some, but it is definitely NOT worth the $21.95. $9.995 at MOST.,I actually bought two of these. The first one I bought a large because I measured 4"" above my knee and that was the appropriate size. It went on fine, but cut off the circulation in my thigh. I reached out to the company via email and asked for an exchange for a larger size and was told I'd have to pay double shipping and cost of the replacement.,Then I started a return with Amazon and decided I'd try a larger size. It seems to fit okay, but there is zero support and very little compression. The only positive thing I have to say is that it did stay in place. It provided no relief and didnt compress at all. I was pretty disappointed.,2nd time and going back, first one was way too big even with measuring guidelines.,I never even tried this last order on so I cant comment on the fit/support.,But I gave a 1 star because it is NOT a new item. I unboxed it and it was inside out. Thought that was strange. When I right-sided it, covered in pet hair. So it went right back into the box and returning. Shame. I really needed this.,This product arrive and it was ripped/torn when I removed it from the box. Definitely looks like it was used or something. No way that could have happened during shipping box fully intact not even bent.,Found out the “super elastic yarn” has latex in it. Should be in bigger print. And I measured my leg, got the recommended size and it was way too tight. So maybe it runs small or I am just in between sizes. Either way I have to return it because I have a latex allergy.,The only place the brace fit snuggly was at the top.  The rest of it felt as if you had nothing on.  It would not offer any support at all during exercise.  There are so many good reviews that I was really surprised that it was so useless!  I returned it and am going back to the Mueller brand.,I am post surgery - chondroplasty and wanted a brace for support and compression.  The brace was too lose around the knee --- lacking compression and support and too tight around the thigh.  Fitted more for a male verses a female.  Short window to return item.  Now I have a brace that does not fit.  Any one want it???,When I received it, the brace was too big for my leg. I brought a small. I had to return it and was charged more than half of what the brace cost to have the item returned. I was not pleased at all with the fit or the return policy. ;(,Carefully following directions, I determined my upper leg to be15.5 inch, a size small.  I was unable to wear the brace more than a few minutes.  It very quickly became unbearably tight around my thigh.  Note, my leg measurement is on the lower end of the size range.  Also, the brace did not provide much support to my knee.  I do not recommend this product.,Update:  I wore the brace for several days. The band on the top continued to be unpleasantly tight.  Perhaps it is tight because it is too high up on my thigh; I’m short, 5’2”.  I also felt  the support for my knee was insufficient.  Strangled thigh & weak knee support; I gave up on it and bought something else."
"Waste of money. Within two days lost all elasticity ended up as a nice leg warmer around my calf. I have a thicker thigh area so purchasing something that wouldn’t cut off my circulation had me favoring this product. My knee is worse off as I walk a day at work this helped zero with support. Since I wore it two days sending product back doesn’t seem right so I’ll take a hit to the wallet but recommend not to purchase product only good if you need warm ankle.,I had high hopes for my brace, after reading all the reviews. It fits well, I can have it on for long periods of time for work without feeling heated by it, scratchy or uncomfortable by the overall fit. HOWEVER, after about 2 hours of constant movement at work the back rolls in on itself, causing the front to slowly roll as well. Taking stairs, which is a necessary with my job, and one of the reasons purchasing this was a must need, is a nightmare. By the time you get where you're needing to go, it's a giant roll under your knee cap. I feel like I spend more time in the restroom fixing it than not by the end of my day.,With that said, I do actually like the product on my days off & I'm sure if I had any other daily routine it would be much more efficient.,I will start by saying that I am right on the sizing border between large and medium.  I got the large.  The elastic at the top and bottom fit very well, and I don't think I would want it any tighter.  unfortunately, the middle, the part around my knee itself where I need the support, has almost no support at this size.  I put it on for a couple of hours to see if it provided more support than first impressions, but it did not.  based on the fit of the elastic, the medium would most likely be too tight at the top and bottom for me.  The product does feel like it would do well it if was tighter against my knee, and it does seem fairly heavy duty, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but it's useless for me.  I will be returning it.  I reached out via email to the seller, but they haven't replied to my email.,I bought this for a possible meniscus tear. I love the product, but woke up to have itchy swelling . I suspected latex allergy, and sure enough...it has latex. I wish I had known this before hand. I'm still going to try to use it, but perhaps use some type of barrier for the latex. I tried it again but big itchy rash no matter which was I adjusted it. BUT, I did find another sleeve that is latex free. Be sure to research.,I was so excited when my Physix Gear Knee Compression sleeve arrive.  The first time I tried it I was wearing shorts and it would not stay up.  It kept rolling down.  It was so annoying that I took it off after about 15 minutes.  Then I decided to try again the following day under my jeans and the same thing was happening, only worse because I had to take off my jeans and pull it up.  The third time I had to do it that morning, I removed it as it totally as  was rolled down to my kneecap.  I was very disappointed in this product.  I will be returning it tomorrow.,Looked nice when I got it, but it started to stretch out after only wearing it a few days. Didn’t really give much support after that. I contacted the seller, and they told me to “hand wash “ it. Like getting it wet was going to “magically” make it shrink or something! LOL! Anyway, I did what they said, but nothing changed and now I can’t return it, so basically a total waste of money!,I’m not a happy person right now. I would not recommend Physix Gear to anyone. They send computer parts in place of a knee brace. But Amazon thinks my time was worth a $5 gift certificate, so there’s that I guess. Oh, and I have to get out to send back this company’s screw up, so I guess they really gave me $5 to cover my gas. Meanwhile, I had this delivered next day because I needed it and now I get to just go shopping again and lose more time. Very disappointed in Amazon and this company!,Sadly life is just too busy and I missed my return window for this. I really wanted something to give my knee a little more support when I am on the treadmill. I liked the appearance of this. That’s pretty much where the stars stop. It just did not have a good enough fit like it was going to help me in anyway, and I found myself constantly readjusting it as it would slip down during my workout. I thought maybe it would be better for day-to-day wear so I tried that as well, but it still would not stay in place.Strange because it felt like it would have a good fit, nice and snug like some others that I have tried and that have stayed up, but this one just did not pass the fall down test.,Messed up my knee. Doc say it's arthritis, gave me a cortisone injection at initial consult.  Got the brace to hopefully give me some stability & support in the area & fingers crossed it would feel good enough to walk. It doesn't unfortunately. I'm keeping it though. My knee was extremely swollen & it helped that & hoping whenever I can get an MRI & possibly another, different injection this may help. It fit ok then. But, we measured the area when it was swollen. Hopefully it will still give me some support or help in the future.,I brought this before and had forgot I had tried it. It was useless. I kept the last one and tossed it back in the closet. I remembered this after I got it. It is not the least bit helpful. Nice colors"
"The material of this sleeve feels great but the work on it is not good. I received it with loose strings along the trim. I was going to try it on but  stretching the sleeve displayed the gaps on the inseam where the loose strings had not properly been sown on.,Inside the package was an e-mail for a customer support but I have yet to receive an answer from them.,Don’t waste your money and time with this product.,I ordered the medium and it fit well around the thigh and calf.  It stayed in place nicely.  Around the knee it was just not quite enough support and didn't seem to help at all.  The brace itself must have been previously returned because it was covered in cat hair.,These were very comfortable and felt tight enough on my thigh to not slip down. Like some others mention, I did get “muffin top” on my thigh, but to me that’s just part of wearing something that needs to be tight to function and is not a problem. I know my thighs aren’t solid muscle and I’m going hiking to work on that, not looking to impress anyone. Great range of motion with them on.,Unfortunately, in the size small they were not even close to tight enough on my knee to provide the level of support I need. I think these could be great for someone looking for very gentle support, but sadly would not work for me.,I wanted to love this and I’m so sad to have to say it didn’t stay up. I wanted it to!! The first two days were wonderful. I have large thighs so I have had the most awful time finding a knee brace that fits right and doesn’t roll down. For the first two days, this stayed right in place. After two days, it began to roll at the top and fall down. I give it a five for support because when it stayed in place, it was perfect. Disappointed because I thought I found the one!,Really tight on my thigh despite using the size chart correctly. Don't think that grip strip is actually silicone because I had an allergic reaction to it.,The compression sleeve did not stay in place. I submitted return request and turned into UPS store. No refund has been issued. Vendor will contact you about being a small business but can’t help you if there are issues. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!!,I recently bought this one and also one by Powerlix due to a torn miniscus issue and while I wear  more heavy duty knee brace for greater activities, I wanted a compression sleeve for wearing all the time to help in the healing by keeping swelling down - along with these other thing I'm trying to do to keep swelling down - like arnica etc.  This one by Physix does not compress enough.  Sure range of motion is good but it comes from not enough compression.  If you are buying for my reasons, buy the one by Powerlix.  I bought Size Small for both.,This knee brace still bunches up behind my knee after wearing/running for a little while. I was right on the cusp of large, so I ordered a Med for a tight fit in hopes it wouldn't bunch. Doesn't seem to give as much support as one of the other top rated braces on amazon. The look of the brace is pretty cool though.  Its good support for walking or when doing yard work.,This the right size for me. Any smaller would be way to tight. Feels great and supportive when I wear it, which is all day. My only complaint is that it slips down a lot and I have to keep pulling it up. When I go for a 30 min walk it falls almost below my knee. That’s the part I don’t like. But around the house it feels great. Down that the virus is here I’m sitting a lot more but I know when I start moving more it will be a problem. I’m not sending it back but I’m definitely going to try another brand.,I have a large leg and wear an XXL. The edges of the compression brace are tight enough... but the middle where I need compression most is way too lose. There's not enough compression around the knee area to give any real support or help with swelling. This is basically a knee warmer on me., I'm pretty disappointed. I didn't expect it to provide the stiff support of a traditional knee brace... I mostly wanted some compression to minimize chronic swelling around my knee from an old injury.  It really isn't helpful."
"Nice material for extremely light support.  I found the elastic at the top was really tight but the rest of the elastic was about the same support as a typical legging.  It rolled down a few times as I was walking and sit/stand motions.  Might use again but will need some modifications so that it isn’t so tight up top.  Would like more of a compression and support.,This brace work excellent at the beginning, even when it slide a little, but I already have two minths with it, and it lost it’s pressure, it pressures my leg but NOT my knee, I wanted to make sure to use it for at least a month to write a review, I ordered two with 2weeks of difference and neither work now. Not worth the price.,The main reason ordering this one was due to the earlier arrival. Unfortunately, I did not pay attention there is only one sleeve for the price listed. I was comparing this product with two other comparable sellers.,I have issues with both knees which requires me to have two. I ordered small. But, it seemed loose around the knee area and was bunching up behind the knee.  I contacted the seller. They suggested washing would fix that issue.,If I  purchase another sleeve the price, it would cost me about 3x more than just buying the one pair from another seller. I am not sure if the material is comparable to this one. But, since the other product has high number of reviews I am willing to take my chances.,Doesn't work, sizing is so wrong.  I bought XL because that's what size it said I needed.  No compression what-so-ever.  I felt like I put a pair of spandex sweatpants on my knee.  I put it on for 5 minutes and it just rolled down my knee. It also looked like it was all stretched out and had been used before and returned.  I immediately tried to return it and even to drop it at an Amazon locker was $5.99.  Not worth sending back.  Maybe I will use my sewing machine to make it smaller and tighter and see if that works.,This fit perfectly according to the sizing guide. I put it on and it was great until I started to actually move. It kept my knee from grinding and popping which was great. But every time I start to move it just rolls down. I’ve tried adjusting it thinking’s maybe I pulled it up too high or down too low but no matter where it’s at it just rolls. It needs better grip in the silicon. I purchased because I wanted a nice discreet sleeve but I’m going to be returning it for one that has Velcro straps.,I won’t say this is a garbage product, it honestly might not work for me because I am heavy set and have pretty squishy thighs.,Disappointed with this. I feel like it didnt do anything for my knee. I was in between sizes according to the size chart so I size up and it ended up being too big, I was constantly pulling it up because it wouldnt stay in place. I'd recommend sizing down if you're in between sizes.. I wish I had.,Just rcvd my pckg!! Don’t know how I feel about it yet. Shipment rcvd on time. I order a sz lg. Can’t tell if it’s helping, to me I think I oils like it a little tighter, maybe I should had ordered a medium 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️. It fit perfect on the thighs but as stated I would like it a little tighter cause I can’t tell if it’s doing what it’s supposed to do. I’ll give it a week and see if it makes any difference if not I’ll sent it back or get a medium.,I measured my leg and ordered according to the chart. I wore this twice.  The first time it was fine and I was hopeful that this was exactly what I needed.  The second time it wouldn't stay up.  It kept rolling down no matter what I did it wouldn't stay up.  Do not recommend or order a size up from what the chart says you need but then I don't know if it would be tight enough to be supportive.,I measured my leg and ordered appropriate size according to size chart. Even though this product says it doesn’t roll down it does... every move I made it rolled. Had to send back.,Did not like too much .  It leaves marks on your knee where the sleeve is .  Wore this on the day I had to go to a dressy event.  I put my fancy dress on and had these marks all over my knees.  They looked like scars.  They took a long time to fade. Do not wear sleeve if you are going to a gala .  I would not buy this again."
"Well, I do not recommend this knee brace unless your legs are solid muscle with minimal fat layer. For older ladies, this is a little tough to achieve. As with most all of the sleeve-style, slide on braces, The elastic that circles the thigh area will make your leg look like a stuffed piece of sausage.  Very frustrating if your main purpose of wearing it is for your workouts!  I’m 5’2”, wear a ladies size 6 in clothing, and I ordered a size medium. Stick with the braces that go on with Velcro, so you can size it to properly fit your thigh.,This seems like a nice enough product for a lot of purposes, but I tried to use this for working out and it doesn’t work well if you do squats. It bunches up behind the knee pretty badly and becomes cumbersome. It fits nice and snug so I couldn’t go down a size to see if that helped.,I returned this knee product. As soon as I put it over my knee, it began to itch like crazy. There were no labels as to what it was made from. I dont have allergies, so its questionable. Looks nice, fit good. Just very itchy.,Ordered this with hopes of addressing a slightly swollen knee and to give support during work outs. I measured 4"" above my knee as instructed. I measured exactly 19.5"" so I ordered the Medium. It totally strangles my thigh and creates a muffin top, so it is doubtful the large will fit. Will have to return it.,I had high hopes for this as the design/color/quality seemed promising, but I made the mistake of not reading the fine, fine print. Perhaps it’s just me but the first and last photos were somewhat misleading - I thought this came in a pair but it was just one side. Describing it as “1 pack” in the color description (vs. 1 piece or something) certainly wasn’t very helpful. Two stars as it was partly my fault and the quality seems otherwise decent, though I didn’t bother putting it on since I need a pair and plan on returning to find a pair at a comparable price point.,I LOVED this for my swollen knee... for the first week. But it soon became useless because the top rolls down and becomes really painful. It fit snug and was perfect until this issue. Washing it did nothing. Wearing shorts with no friction to pull it down did nothing. Too bad because otherwise it’s great.,It feels like it cuts off circulation and it ends up sliding down my leg by the end of the day... I feel zero relief what so ever and don't see why anyone would give this item a rating above a 1 star. This is probably the most disappointed I've been in an item I've purchased on Amazon.,In theory this is a great band. But wearing it outside of home/with activity it didn't work out for me. It kept rolling down and at one point it rolled my skin & pinched me really bad. If you are not doing much movement this is great but because I wore it out I ended up taking it off very quickly. It didn't stay put and it rolled a lot which made it very uncomfortable.,I measured my leg and was smaller then the large that I bought. It was cutting my leg on the top. I rolled it down to my knee. It seemed to work better.,but cant wear tights with it. I'm going back to my old brace. This brac e is what it says it's for ,....support, but very little. Didn't work for me.,It won’t stay up. It’s a waste of my money."
"Cuff way too tight. Cuts off circulation.,I measured myself and purchased the recommended size, however the fit was very uncomfortable for any length of time.,I needed them for long bike rides and I could not endure the tightness around the upper cuff.,purchased according to the given measurements but so tight couldnt get it on ... pity ~ didn't try for a larger size but that might've been the solution ~ oh well !,I took a chance on ordering this and it just didn't work out.  For me personally, the fabric is uncomfortably thick and the silicone grips way too tight. I can't imagine wearing this.  It's so thick, it would be immediately noticeable under clothes.  I didn't try it during a workout because it was so uncomfortable the second I put it on.,I purchased this compression sleeve due to meniscus tears.  In  future I'll stick with my adjustable knee brace/strap (an actual brace, not a sleeve).,Not what you think it is,It goes on easy, support is not great. It does not slip, because it rolls! And it's a pain, when you have to stop and unroll.,While this product is helping support my knee, I’m disappointed that the top, even with the gripping inside, does not stay put. It rolls down and I have to fix it several times a day. If i don’t fix it almost immediately, it rolls down so much it actually causes me pain. I don’t need anymore pain!,I bought this on the recommendation of my sister who is a physical therapist and several of her colleagues have recommended this sleeve.  However, after measuring my knee of 3 different days and being squarely in the center of the XL range, the top of the sleeve continues to roll down to the extent its largely not usable! Under a pair of jeans it rolls down.  On top of jeans it rolls down. On top of yoga pants its bearable but as soon as I walk more than 10 steps it rolls down.  The company contacted me to do a review and to please let them know of any issues before leaving unfavorable feedback.  Never heard back,  so telling it like it is today.,Good support & comfortable tension on the knees and great design... But it breaks up not so greatly around the switching already after 3rd time using it. Not sure if I've got a defective one but now I've worn it about a week and I can see my skin through the widen seams... not so pretty but still does the job, so 3 stars!.,Sizing was totally incorrect. I measured 4"" above my knee while wearing jeans and the measurement was 17 1/4. According to the size chart I should order a medium, which I did. When I received it it was extremely tight in the thigh, but not so in the knee, almost loose. I would have needed to order an extra large for the thigh and I'm a size 2 in women's clothing.,I followed the sizing instructions (I'm 5'1"" and 125 lbs) and ordered a Small. It cut the circulation right off no matter whether I put it under or over running gear. Not sure I want to try a medium. The small covered 1/3 of my leg.,Right knee is causing concern. Know of lack of cushion tissue on inside of knees. So I hoped that this would give me both relief and support. It’s been more my issue that my knees are not what they should be. The brace has a quieting effect. A doctor appt awaits me and I am hoping the knee, brace and my patience hold until then. The pain center keeps moving. One day inside knee. Next day my top calf is screaming. But the brace does allow me movement freedom."
"My left knee was hurting a lot this helped for about a week the support seems to loosen up not as tight as I need ?,Sizing way off. order one size smaller. Got the recommended size and its to big so it offers very little support.,I bought the knee brace cause my old one is chunky and feels heavy at the end of the day. I am constantly readjusting this knee brace as it has a tendency to slip. It also does not come with a compression sock but it has a cheaper sleeve that you  can use to wear underneath.  I have tried everything to make it stay in place, so far no luck.,Bought a large as my measurement was the very low end of the size chart. It was way too tight. I can tell it’s what I need, so an XL is on the way.,Brace is too small at top edge creating a muffin top effect!  My thought measures 17 1/2” at 4” above the kneecap.  According to the manufacturer’s size chart a size medium should fit up to a 19 1/2” thigh!  I am returning it,I have tried so many different knee braces without much luck. This knee brace had some good reviews and was reasonably priced. When I first received this it actually performed fairly well. The only time I used it was when I did my daily walk in the neighborhood. I went to put it on over the weekend and it already has a tear, which is very disappointing. I’m going to try and sew it up with the hopes of still being able to use it, but I shouldn’t have to do this. And for a description of my physique, I am 5’ 5”, 117 lbs and a 60 year old female.,This is not well designed. It has an extra elastic band at the top, I'm guessing to prevent it from sliding down the leg, but it's too tight and uncomfortable. Then there's not enough support in the knee area, which is what I needed. I returned it.,It's ok, for the price. The top rolls down no matter what I do, but the support is adequate.,This knee sleeve is not even close to knee support. However it only lasted 2 or 3 wearings before the top rolled down cutting off the blood flow in my leg and there is no reinforcement sides for the knee. This knee sleeve is definitely not an item that I can recommend to my friends.,very bad do not waste your money, I just arrived at my house and I am using it and it is useless, it was better for me to use a half of mine, I was carried away by the comments of purchases that I think are false, within  a while when I go to the gym I return them at once!  don't waste your time and money"
"I tried to use this product for several days.  At first it was fine than it started slipping down.  I washed it hoping that would help but it didn't so I stopped using it.,I returned them because the upper edge is really tightly bound with not a lot of give, its too bad because the material otherwise appeared to be very breathable with a nice stretch.,Item arrived on time; the items box was torn, as if someone had previously had a problem opening the box.  Item ordered was the correct size as described on the website but seems stretched out.  I have another knee brace and it has a lot more support, same size. Do not recommend.,Far too big even in the smallest size. I measured according to the chart and while I was at the smallest range of the size chart, I was still hoping it would provide some support. I have a similar brace from Ace that is also a size small and it is actually tight enough to provide support/stability. I’m 5’1 and 105 lbs for reference.,If you’re just wearing it casually, it’s very comfy. To actually do CrossFit or lift with it, it’s definitely not enough support. Also I took it to my deadlift class & everything was ok for about 30 mins then it kept rolling down constantly & wouldn’t stay in place. It was the appropriate fit, not too tight or loose & I was right in the middle of the size chart so it wasn’t the fit, just sucked.,Wore it once during cross fit exercise did not stay up and was a nuisance. Have not worn it since as it is a hazard to depend on it during my exercise. I am hesitant to try another one of these things again as it was my first try....,The fabric that this sleeve is made of is bulky and doesn’t breathe well at all. I had knee surgery a few years back and have found a nice thin brace helps at work but this one certainly was a disappointment.,Feels great but will not stay in place. The first time I sit the knee brace rolls down at the top which pinches and is uncomfortable. I end up not wearing it long because of the inconvenience,I've had these knee sleeves for about 9 months. They started fine. They don't give a lot of support but gave enough to help with walking or using at a standing desk. Unfortunately, they were stretched out after about 3 months of use to the point where they slip off my knee even with minimal movement. I can't use them for walking anymore unless I want to stop every hundred feet or so to pull them back up. I can still use them for my standing desk, but even then they slip a couple hours of use. I won't buy another pair.,Ordered a small per the directions and size chart.,Brace came, it was like my knee was wearing a bulky unsupportive sweater. Fabric bunched under my knee.,Super uncomfortable. No compression or support."
"During a workout it will bunch up and slip down off your leg. I measured my leg twice before ordering and I ordered the right size but it still bunched up and moved down my leg.,super tight and shorter than pictured. I am average weight and hight. couldn't use these because they were much shorter than pictured and pretty darn tight. Missed my window to return. If  you are petite and super slim you'll have no problems wearing these under clothes.,Bought this item because of the highly rated reviews. Now Im second guessing the authenticity of these reviews. Hours after wearing this brace, I developed severe welt rashes and intense itching. I hope I don’t end up in the hospital for this.,I have used several sleeves over the years and this is definitely at the bottom of my list when ranking. There is a tag with the size sewn into the top inside that rubs and irritates the skin. I cut the tag out and it didn't seem to help.  It costs almost as much as the product to return it so I guess I am stuck with it.,Size chart is not accurate bought a size larger since I was close to the next size. The top rolls and dose not stay in place. I contacted the company asking to exchange for the next size up. They offered a 70% refund after I showed proof of purchase for the next size. No thank you.,First time I put it on  within a few minutes of wearing it  it started to roll down at the top of my leg which became very uncomfortable  and somewhat painful.  I was very disappointed.,Didnt work for me product kept rolling down my thighs. I have large thighs and it rolled down within first few minutes of wearing them.,This was like wearing compression leggings that were 3 sizes too small on my knee, and I ordered the size specified for my measurements according to the size chart.,Would be a great product if it fit me properly. I am 5'5"", 145lbs, athletic/curvy build and ordered the Medium. It is way too small on my thigh, so much to where it's almost a tourniquet. Unable to use this product, but it does seem to be constructed with quality and durability. Would have been a winner if it fit.,Not great. Im sure you can find better here on Amazon.  It roles down:(;  yes, i have thunder-thighs but com'on it still sucks!  I dont know why i kept it. I suck too 🤦‍♀️"
"My knee brace might be the wrong size.  I have a heavier upper thigh and my brace rolled on the back of the leg.  I know a larger one would not work, but a smaller one might if it isn't too tight.  May need a different style.,Have only had it 3 days and there is already a tear. Provides great support but I’m guessing it’s not going to be very durable.,Too small. But don’t like lettering if you wanted to wear under white or light colored slacks. But size was too small main reason for returning it.,Well made. Great support while I could wear it but back bunched up pretty quickly. I have had many & most do eventually cause bunching behind knee pulling entire support up. Fitting not accurate. I measured as instructed & still too tight.,I was pretty disappointed with this knee brace. I just needed a little support for my right knee when working out or on my feet for a while but it constantly slides down. I got the size that was recommended for my leg circumference but it didn’t help. Any smaller and it would be way too tight. Maybe I should have ordered a size larger but I was afraid i wouldn’t have the support I need. Sorry but for me this was a waste of money.,This support is not like the picture.  It not as long as it appears.  I have trouble with it wrinkling.  I do not recommend this product.,Hi Adam,,The Brace that I had purchased for my husband, was too wide, and didn't offer any ""Real"" support.,His was a Medium size, but when it arrived it was still too large w/o proper support!!,Please help him out, as he will need a knee replacement when they start doing elective surgery.,I believe a size small will benefit him the most.,Stay safe you, and Sam!!!,Except the top end would roll down my leg and become tighter.  I had the proper size and it worked fine for a while, but didn't last too long before it would start rolling down.,I  have been having trouble with my knee. I liked the knee brace and it supported my knee well. The Only draw back was that I felt like I needed help putting it on.,It didn't provide a whole lot of stability or support, but it did help some. It also scoots down your leg with movement over a short amount of time."
"I measured as It said I needed to and it said I was a LARGE. I thought that was CRAZY....amd guess what, it's WAAAAY to big. I can fit it on my upper thigh!!!,I measured my knee area so the fit would be correct. I slipped it on and the top edge and the bottom edge dig into my leg so hard the pain was unbearable.,I purchased this knee brace due to all the Stellar reviews unfortunately I have large thighs and with all the expansion and contraction of that muscle group the knee brace won't stay up and it ends up sliding down and gathering around my knee. I have to adjust the knee brace at least two to three times an hour the support it provides appears to be fantastic the knee swelling has gone down and the compression seems to be working positively it just is a matter of it not staying in place whenever necessary.,Got a small. I weigh 155 and S feels like a M. Do not feel good support. I’ve only used twice in 3 months. Doesn’t really work. I should’ve returned.,too tight,The sizing has changed.  The small is now one inch bigger so the tight support is no longer there. Used to be my go-to knee support for working out.  Very disappointed.,Measured my knee - fit in the medium range - but ordered a small as well - small worked and isn't really as snug as I thought it would be either.  The cost to return - half of the cost of the product - had I known - would have picked another product.,This product is a light sock not a product for a athlete. More support is needed for serious athletes.,Although I measured my leg following instructions, the sleeve was too big to be useful.  I was offered a replacement at a reduced price which I declined. I didn't want to spend any more money without some assurance that the next one would fit.,Well made and good initial support, but unfortunately did not work for me. It would not stay in place as I walked, eventually rolling down my thigh."
"Measured length from knee up. Got appropriate size based on that measurement. Unfortunately is too tight.  A measurement around the thigh area is needed too. To return I would only get $6.00, so will give to someone else. Otherwise, if you get the right size it would be ok.,There is not enough support for my knee. I also ordered one for my cousin and she says the same thing.,My leg measured 21"" 4 inches above the knee but I find the large size still a touch too tight for comfort at the top. The rest of it fits okay and it actually could be a little tighter in the lower part. I guess I need one that is made for someone whos thigh is bigger than their calf.,This did not fit my knee. It fit above and below my knee but no compression was on my knee. I should have gotten a smaller size than what the size chart claimed.,easy to care for, comfortable. 4 months in and the elastic is starting to wear so it is starting to slide more and bunch at the back of my knee, but it still helps a lot,It has potential to be give good support, I used the measuring chart and ordered the medium which turned out to be too big, I gifted it to a friend and ordered the small size, but even that is slightly loose. It is well made, I just wish it was a little bit more snug to give better support.,Overall, this does what is says it will. After a week or so of wearing it daily, it started losing its shape around the top, and started rolling down my knee during the day. Now it does nothing because it sits in a drawer.,I measured 4"" above the knee.  The instructions on this seller's page should be more direct as to which part of the knee.  Top, middle or bottom of the patella.  Now I must return these items.,It feels like a nice product and while I was standing it felt okay.  But as soon as I sat down it started rolling, pinching, and cutting off circulation.  I'd LOVE to have a functional knee brace, but this just isn't it.,I ordered a medium - and it fit, in that the top and bottom bands were snug - but there was no compression or support to the knee at all. It felt like a sock over my knee with elastic holding it in place."
"Did not get me the support I was looking for. I ordered the correct size, it just didn’t provide the support my hurting knee needs.,I ordered it based on the chart and it was still too loose on my knee. I strongly suggest going a size smaller,Too tight for my stout thigh - I ordered the largest offered & it was binding into my fat. 5.99 to return an 11.99 product. eBay?,It’s a nice product. Just does not fit me.,Does not stay up. It is reasonably comfortable,but slips down frequently.,For me, this sleeve caused my lower leg to swell to the point where my legs hurt more than the pain in my knee that I purchased this sleeve for.,It's not a bad product, it just didn't work for me.,Measured per directions and it still didn’t fit. I have big thighs and small calfs.  Varicose veins behind my knees. Would work perfect if they had a bit more room for bigger thighs.,I purchased a Small; however,  it is not tight enough on me.  Had an Extra Small size been offered, it would have been perfect.  I would consider this product again if they had the right size for my needs.,I was so disappointed when I got my package and realized that there was only one knee brace. Why would anyone buy just one? I intended to use this whilst working out at the gym, because I do crossfit and I really wished this could help me from getting injured or to help me recover from any pain. The material seems good, but I will not use it unless I get another one!,I have a small leg and this is not tight enough to offer any support.,I gave this a 3 because sizing is way off, I was between sizes and it said order the smaller one and it’s too tight on my thigh. It’s very comfortable everywhere else, but it cuts into my skin on my thigh and rolls down."

She wears it for work and uses it for a least for 10 hour day.,I’m disappointed. I thought this was a pair and isn’t.

This is ridiculous!,it was the wrong size for me someone did near my knee cap, by mistake didn't do  it higher  which I know.,I measured my leg and got the recommended size but I can only wear this brace while walking around. When I try to work out in it which involves running, squats, etc, the brace starts to roll down. I do not recommend at all.,This brace is okay. The material is light and seems breathable. The top and bottom bands are a little too tight for comfort. The middle of the brace where I wanted more compression for my meniscus area is too loose.,This gives like no support. My knee felt exactly the same wearing it as it feels not wearing it. Waste of money,Slides out of place more than I would have liked.  I guess it does the job in a pinch.,They work well. For a short time but did  stretch out after a week use as I need to wear them all day. The size range is  on the small side when using sizing chart for people with lager  thighs this is problem as well,When wearing this item with no bottoms or shorts on it stays in place for the most part, may have to readjust every now and again. However I’ve tried wearing this to work under jeans and with looser jeans it sidles down my leg, with tighter jeans it rolls down. Not happy with it.,Received today. I measured exactly and went with the Medium because that was the directions. I should have paid attention to my instincts and bought the Large  Order up a size. Giving 1 Star because it doesn’t fit. Otherwise it seems nice"

Rolls easily.,I bought this to use during soccer practice and games while recovering from and MCL tear.  Fits snugly to the knee which I like but it constantly slips down and bunches up above my knee after only a few minutes of running...very frustrating!!

I wouldn't waste your money on this if you're looking for a knee sleeve.,I bought the knee support brace for running purposes. I run (min) 5mph-10mph (max) and it did not hold up.

I returned the first item and I guess I’ll just give the other one away.,it was well made but it was to difficult to get on so I had to return it.,Worked the first few days. Stretched out after about a week and was useless after. Also picked up lint from clothing and was ugly.,I bought two, one for each leg. I have moderate pain in my lower knee cap during and after short runs. These don't provide any support for my lower knee. They are breathable but that's probably due to the lack of support. Very very disappointed."

I made it work as much as possible.,It's a little bit tight needed to order a bigger size.  The pink threading was coming out had to cut some threading out but other then that it's pretty good.,The plastic lining irritates my skin and causes it to swell. Not good at all."
"Bought this for my husband who hasn’t tried it yet.  Will be happy to respond later.,It doesn’t stay in place,Dejarón el producto en otra dirección, esa no es la entrada de mi casa.,I measured and ordered the right size. The top elastic is way too tight and there’s no support in the knee,Abuse our relationship with solicits email.,Used sizing chart, but still too small.,Kept rolling down,Rolls down fits horribly,Does not work,Was not a tight compresion"
"Could not use it it just rolled down when I stood up,It is not tight enough to help and I bought the small,I'm sorry,  but I have very large legs. Working on losing weight.  These are made well. Unfortunately,  for me, they roll down and don't stay put. I may have to opt for that special tape for my knee issue.,At first I like it.  It very soft.  It only give very little support.,Rolled,Only used for about a weak, and stitching unraveled at top seam, resulting in a hole. Really poor quality.,Not secure enough,Doesn't stay up,Too big and cost a lot to return.,I like it but wish it was one size bigger. I ordered a1x needed 2x to fit my leg above my knee"
"Rolls up, squished my leg was gunna return it but for half the cost of the item to ship it back...I kept it and gunna sell it at a garage sale,i used support during exercise,Their measuring technique doesn't work.,Knee gear is okay, it didn't gave me the tight  support around the knee I wanted,To small,Great support.  However, I mine has a manufacturing defect.  It arrived with a snag...I cut the snag off & now there is a hole.,This product has been used. It smells like sweat and it has animal fur. Disgusting!!,Sleeve kept slipping down.,Dislike, fit was weird and too bulky.,Way too tight."
"Never able to use because it ran small.,I measured and bought the right size. This brace does not work! Buy a different one!,Im very small so i did not fit well to be benificial to me.,That's all... disappointed,Too tight at the top. Tried size medium and large. Both were equally tight. Liked the rest of the fit though.,Trash,Too tight at the edges but loose in the center,Fit is too small above the knee,I've never been allergic to any fabric, but using this brace has given me severe itchy hives for almost a week all around my upper knee.,Wasn’t tight enough and didn’t give much support"
"to small,I really wish I didn’t have to leave such a low review. I was initially excited to reciece my knee support brace. I run and do intense workouts but I am sometimes restricted due to pain in my right knee (post surgery). The current brace I use is great but bulky so I wanted to try a sleeve. I was always reluctant because I assumed they would just roll down. Based on the reviews I decided to give it a try, but the moment I put it on it rolled down in the back. I tried it a myriad of ways and it still rolled down. I confirmed the sizing was appropriate and it was but the knee brace still rolls down.,Recommend,It seems comfortable enough.. however, I am not sure it provides as much support as other braces I have used. Works fine for walks & short runs. Could not sustain longer workouts though -- if you are needing a brace that provides true support, I would probably seek an alternative option. This one feels barely more supportive than a compression sock would be. Size fit as expected though.,I measured 4"" above the knee, I got a little less than 17 inches, I was told to get small and I did.  It was very tight, it looks like medium would be better. 17"" should be medium not small.,Not good. No support at all.,I bought these to put a nice compression on my knees at night. What I got was a major burn from the zip zag no slip edge on the top of the sleeve. Blisters all the way around my thigh. It burns like hell. These should not even be sold. This picture is 2 days later,Sadly, the sizing was WAY off on this. I measured according to the description, and I would fit their size Large. Received the large and it would barely go past my knee. It was so tight it cut off circulation for the minute I attempted to try it on. Everyone is built differently, and I have a 19 inch area right above my knee. I wish this would have fit given the other great reviews that help relieve knee pain. I had to return it.,I measured my knee..I truly need support..but when I put it on to wear ...I had to roll it down once to feel comfortable ... nice support,This item came but its the wrong size> I follow the sizing chart but it's not true to size."
"As you can see I have big thighs. I did not measure simply ordered a large and recieved a large even got an email asking if i recieved the correct size. I haven't been wearing it Long. It is definitely squeezing my upper thigh it isn't as tight around my knee as i want it to be. While Walking the top of the band which has rubber on it scrunches up in the back. I will try the elliptical while wearing the sleeve and update my review.,Oredered a Large received a Small.,I have only worn this brace twice a week for 3 weeks, 1.5 hours per time. Every use it is clear to me that these aren’t built to last.  As per the photos, you can see how it does not hold up, rolling over itself on the way down.  Do not waste money on these if you’re using them for any kind of athletic purpose, there are much better braces out there.,It rolls down and end edges are tighter than the rest of the brace. This makes it very uncomfortable. I did not feel like it gave me any support and did not alleviate any of my knee pain.,I had developed some knee issues as a result of a very severe sprained ankle.  I felt I needed more support on my knee, and was looking for a compression-type solution.  I measured my thigh exactly how the instructions said to, and bought the brace according to the measurement.  When I tried it on, it seemed like it would be fine.  So the first day I actually put it on to wear during a workout, I noticed the top elastic was pretty tight, but didn't think much about it until about two minutes in...when I started feeling a Baker's cyst developing.  I'm not saying the brace CAUSED the cyst, but the tightness of the top elastic was a factor because I've been wrapping my knee with an old fashioned ace bandage ever since and have not gotten another cyst.  I can't wear the brace anymore (only wore it one time) and threw the box away so I can't return it.  I really think if the level of compression around the knee joint was the same as the top elastic, it would have been okay, but it wasn't.,My measurement is 17”, the top size for Small and the bottom size for Medium, so I purchased the Medium. OMG, it is painfully tight.  The sleeve left constriction bands on my thigh in ten minutes of uncomfortable wearing.  I re-measured to see if I’d made a mistake.  Nope, 17” four inches above my knee.  This thing is mis-sized and feels like a tourniquet.  I feel that trying to wear it will do more harm than good.,Have been buying the tape for years and was excited about the new product I ordered 3 for the special introduction. There was no mention of size so I assumed one size fit all. I got 3 mediums and they are very small, I am 5'6"" and weight 135 this cuts off my circulation and could never be worn by my two brother in laws I was going to give the other ones too. I have written the company twice but have not heard anything back. I would love to try a larger size but mine looks nothing like the picture it is shorter and very tight,I'm pretty disappointed with this brace. I got a mild case of jumpers knee after locking my leg when I jumped off of something, so was basically looking for extra support for workouts. Now I knew I wasn't going to get super high quality for $10, so bear in mind if you just need something extra to help, it get through the hurdle of leg day at the gym just fine.,Now for the cons: the stitching on the top and bottom doesn't have a lot of give, but the middle is SUUPER stretchy. I could have gone down a size easily but the edges would have cut off circulation to my legs. The silicone inside is nice to keep it in place, but didnt stay up for my HIIT workout or during running. Overall I would give it an eeeehhh. Its better than nothing and I'll keep using it, but I would DEFINITELY not buy this again.,I purchased 2 sleeves for $11.95.  I followed the instructions (17 inches) and determined that I required a size medium.  Unfortunately, they are a bit loose; size small would have been a better choice.  Eventually I informed Physix and was told that AFTER purchasing a replacement, Physix would refund ONE knee sleeve, i.e., not two.  Later, I was told that they would refund me 20% of my purchase...oh well, so much for ""***We know you're a big deal, and we'll only provide you with the finest product and service around, or your MONEY BACK!***"",FYI, at the same time, I also purchased a pair from Blitzu...their knee sleeves too, were loose.  HOWEVER, after informing them of that I required a size small, they IMMEDIATELY provided a refund.  Blitzu is true to their word.,I measured as instructed. My measurement was 17"". The small goes to 17"" and the medium starts at 17"". I ordered the medium and it was too big. It was tight around the thigh only, not providing any support for the knee. I am returning and unsure about trying the small. I'm worried it will be too tight and I will have to send it back again."
"I put these on my left knee and in less than 1 minute my skin was burning and the brace was way way too tight.  I had deep red marks on my leg at the top of the brace and below the knee as well.  Size was much smaller than listing indicated for L.,It didn’t help my specific pain.,I love how it fits perfect. 👍,Comfortable and doesn't slip but doesn't provide much support or compression at all. Hasn't helped my knee pain at all.,I LOVE the material , however, I ordered an XL and it was too tight. I returned  it and ordered  a XXL. By the time I had worn it for 6-7 hours it started sliding. I had to keep pulling it up. Maybe consider making the nonslip strip at the top wider for those of us that have bigger legs.,It is advertised to not slip but I definitely does although it’s very comfortable otherwise, not really sure if it’s doing much since I can’t really wear it around cause it does slip.,L/XL still too tight,I measured as instructed and ordered appropriate size. Just received but if I wore this, I'd cut the circulation off to my leg! A little compression is good but this was horribly small...will re-order and try again before making full judgment on whether it works or not.,This sleeve stretched after one wear and did not stay in place.,Would probably use it during running or light cardio."
