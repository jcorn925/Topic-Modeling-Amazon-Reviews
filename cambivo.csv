review
"These compression knee sleeves are well made and looks good. Used them twice on hikes on off road trails. The first time the tops work there way down and gets bunched up just above the knee cap area. Kept pulling them up to no avail. Ended up taking them off towards end of hike. The second time I rolled the top elastic bands down a couple of times to where they stopped sliding down on the first hike. This worked but was tighter on the top. The sliding down makes sense to me in that as your walking the muscle flexing of the quadriceps and hamstrings pushes the sleeve down towards the knee cap. If these knee sleeves were shortened on top by about 2 or 3 inches to where the elastic band sits just above the knee cap would eliminate the sliding issue. Don’t know if other people have had this same issue? Will continue to use them.,I received my knee braces on Thursday, April 5th, and was so excited, I have torn meniscus in both knees, put them on immediately & saw a difference within the hour, mind you I was in my house.  On Friday, April 6th I wore them to work & raved about them to all, by the end of the day, I was sad to tell others that they kept falling down my leg & had to keep pulling them up.  By the time I got home they had completely fallen down. When they stay put they take the strain off my knees & I was able to walk up & down stairs, and get out of my chair with no pain, but unfortunately I can no longer wear these unless I’m sitting & not walking around, they didn’t cost that much, but the money I paid & only get 1 day use, that’s says a lot about this product.  I will keep searching for another compression knee brace.,Excellent fit. Good support. Will give further reviews after more use. The stitching is already tearing in one of these braces. Therefore I must change my review to one star.,Even with silicone around the upper edge of the sleeve it still slips and yes, I ordered the correct size. Within about 5 minutes of use they started slipping. If I didn't pull them up they bunched up around my knees.,Even though they are tight and fit correctly they offer little to no support or compression. It's like wearing thin soaks.,I ended up returning these for a more thicker sleeve from them. If you need good support look elsewhere.,Bought these a few months ago and was surprised at the price when i received them. Wore them for a few hours and within a few days the elasticity was gone and they kept slipping down.  i took out the 2nd one and started wearing that one and again for a few days it was fine and then just wouldn't stay in place.  DO NOT RECOMMEND AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DOESN'T CARE.  The only 100% Satisfaction is that they sold another pair to an unsatisfied client.,It doesn't do any good if they slide down!! When I first put them on the were comfortable. Once I actually got up and walked they slide right down. I didn't even get to doing a real workout in them, I simply walked a flight of steps and they dropped. Not satisfied at all and now I'm still left with knee pain,photo very misleading ... it's short and it rides down and is very uncomfortable behind the knee.,to be more specific, i have an another knee sleeve, incrediwear. This one is made to look the same length...,the incrediwear is much longer functionally and i can wear all day, sitting sleeping... trying to bend my leg,much, sitting it bunches up behind the knee and is very uncomfortable.,Like many people have already stated, these knee COMPRESSION SLEEVEs (these are NOT braces), do not stay where you place them on your leg.  They will bunch up right below the knee after the second day of usage.  While out walking with one of these on, every 10-15 steps I would have to pull the blasted thing up.  After the third time of pulling it up, I decided to take it off, as it was not doing what it was supposed to do.,Now, why these are no where near being a brace: 1) as stated already, it will not stay put; 2) does not provide support for side to side movement; 3) you can still over extend your knee.,About the only positive about this product is I can fold it up and place it in a pocket when it falls off the knee.  Oh, and the price was right.,I am giving it two stars, as it did help for the few days I did use it before I switched to a true knee brace.,I followed the fit guide and purchased the med size. these are tight and cut off blood flow. I believe these would work great if I would have ordered a larger pair. I cannot use them due to the fit. I kept them to long to return as I thought they would stretch out a bit and fit better. They have not ...,I ordered the XXL size because my thigh above the knee measured about 24"".  This is the most uncomfortable, nonfunctional knee support I have ever worn.  It slides down off thigh and bunches up behind the knee.  The top rolls constantly so I have to keep pulling it up.  It's painful at times when it slides/rolls down.  Totally disappointed!!"
"Not a strong enough compression for what I need. It might be good for someone that doesn't have a wonky knee. My patella slides out of the groove and I thought this would work when I workout, it does not. I think I need something stronger. Sending back. I measured my thigh circumference just as indicated. I do have thick thighs but I am fit. If I were to have gone a size smaller they would have been too tight. This is in response to the company telling me that I got the wrong size. This is not true. It's the level of compression that is not enough for me, not the size. I work in healthcare where I measure legs for compression socks so I know how it is supposed to properly fit. Don't listen to the company's comment to this review.,I had a torn ACL, but had a patella graft repair?  My knee still feels loose once in a while so I thought this compression sleeve would help me gain some stability.  I was a little apprehensive about this product especially since I measured as a medium, but I usually get xl for everything else clothing wise.  I followed the video instructions on putting on the sleeve.  It felt like a very tight fit.  Almost to the point I was afraid it would cut off my circulation, but it didn't.  Anyhow the sleeve is tight on the ends(thigh, and calf) but where I need the support around my knee it doesn't feel snug at all.  I don't feel any support.  I played some volleyball (I know, I shouldn't with a bad knee), and it didn't sag or drop down at all, but at the same time I didn't feel any support either.  It was also surprisingly cool?  I thought it would be warm/hot and I 'd be sweating under the sleeve, but nope.  I've only worn it once, so if I feel things change I will update this review.  (Maybe after I wash it the middle part will tighten up?),Too tight around the thigh and too loose around the knee...Maybe they should have you take a couple/few different measurements at different positions that will produce a range that corresponds with a size and then address common issues like, "" If you fall at the lower scale of L, depending on your build, you might want to consider sizing down if for instance you are (insert commonly used symbology for somatypes ie (pear shaped , apple, shaped, etc. or even maybe distinguishing between how the fit can vary from self-identified male bodied individuals (men) as opposed to how the fit can vary from self-identified female bodied individuals (women) , as gathered from customer- reported data.,I bought the medium because I measured in at 18 inches, right in the middle of medium but apparently you have to size up to actually wear these. These are so tight I can feel them cutting off my circulation and that is not healthy! I've worn knee braces before so I'm not sure why these are so bad. And not only this, but the stitching on both at the top is already unraveling from just taking them out of the package. I tried emailing the company because I'm unsatisfied but my email server sent the email back saying that their email system refused to connect with my email system. Really bad product and really bad customer service.,The packaging and the compression sleeve on first sight look and feel great, however after 30 minutes wearing the sleeve on my right knee I noticed it slipping and bunching. I spent all day pulling at it..... I wear a Large (I have other sleeves which all fit).,No response from Mfr, so I am forced to return.,My legs have been likened to tree trunks, presumably because of their size given they have no bark nor provide shelter to woodland creatures.  While the sleeves do fit my glorious trunks, the top rolls down, creating this very unpleasant tourniquet effect in my knee bend.  While I am fond of blue, legs of the living are not intended to be this color.  Alas, I am doomed.,Packaging was nice. Visually looks nice. Has anti sliding marks on top and bottom.,Execution does nothing for me. Maybe they’ll work for someone else, but the only compression happening is in the top and bottom. My leg looks as though it’s made up of 3 lumps and my whole leg looks like it’s swollen in all 3 lumps.,I know it’s no too small because on my knee there is minimum compression. There’s not stability to this. The pictures in the description looks extremely in realistic in how this is actually working for me. The anti slide didn’t go over my pants very well unless I rolled down the grips, but as the picture shows, you can wear them on your bare skin. This to me feels really tight..... but not in a “it’s keeping it in place kind of way, but again, the support to my knee feels like absolutely nothing is happening.,Well, I bought these to help with my knees when it comes to hiking, I thought maybe they would help. I never got to see if they do or don't because after 1 min of walking they slid down.....they were hard to slide on so I figured they would do what they claim to and stay put but nope....they slide right down.  I did not even get to start hiking lol, I just put them on and as I was walking from the parking spot to the trail they slide down, put them up about 3 more times before giving up with them and taking them off.,They do not stay.,Update: 5/12/2020,Got another pair a size smaller to see if they stay, They seem to stay better then the XXL ones I got previously but they still slide down before to long which means I still couldn't use them for hiking,in terms of providing support and stability, these braces work effectively. they provide enough compression and are quite breathable. only one problem, however: they do not stay up. they roll down in the back of the thigh area quite easily. it's usually only one though. but it's annoying enough for me to to not give a complete 4 star review. if they didn't roll down and i didn't have to constantly pull them up, it would be five stars because my knees feel so much better with them on, and i don't fear them giving out like i used to.,I really wanted to like this knee brace. it is probably one of the most comfortable I've ever worn and its a great mix of light support and comfort. That said it simply will not stay up. I wore it in the evening when it arrived and i was very pleased with it. But the next morning when i walked to my bus it immediately started slipping. After a block it wasn't even covering my knee anymore. i had to readjust it seemingly after ever dozen steps. If you need something for injury recovery around the house this is great, but i would never trust this brace to stay put during any kind of activity. And yes I measured carefully and bought the correct size. It is snug as it should be but the liner including the silicon inside the top band just do not keep the brace in place."
"- It’s like wearing a sock.,- The sleeve may not fall down easily due to the gel inside but that’s only on the top inner lip so the sleeve will still bunch/ slide up your leg from the bottom.,- If you want compression for a little extra stability order a size down,- If you want more than a little extra stability/compression then you’ll want something else as this WILL NOT provide it.,- I see images of people working out in these, I would personally not advise it. Instead lookup and purchase one by someone like Evolution Athletics, Cerberus, or Mark Bells STrong sleeves.,Overall: it felt like I was lied to and all the positive reviews also seem a bit sketchy now that I’ve held these in my hands and tried one on.,It COULD be just that these were too large... I wanted another one (black/red) but the shipping was going to take forever, and this was TWO for the same price as that ONE so I went for it. Didn't really feel any support, I still had to supplement with ace bandages b/c my knee half-slipped 'out' during a kneeling portion of my workout (so painful) even while wearing this. I recommend you size down if you're between sizes. I got another one (same exact look, just a different brand and has red on it) and sized down and it's perfect. I can't say for sure that this is an inferior brand but I am now happy with a different one in a size down, even though it is effectively twice the price b/c it came as a single brace, when this was 2.,I occasionally have pain in one or both knees due to sciatic nerve pain caused by tricky hips. When this happens climbing the stairs to my apartment can be really uncomfortable, and I have two dogs so we’re in and out a lot.,I selected these due to the great reviews and I was hoping that they would be able to replace the expensive and non-reusable kinesiology tape I’m currently using to support my knees.,I bought an XL according to the size chart and I was disappointed to find that the sleeves fit my thighs and calves as they should, but they’re way too loose on my actual knee. I typically wear a size 16 jeans, so I think that since I’m not an athletic build, my legs are curvier than the body type that these were designed for.,I’m sure they work great if you have an athletic build, but they were unfortunately not for me. I gave 2 stars because the material is very comfortable and if they had fit I’m sure I could have worn them all day.,These are only ok. I'm not thrilled with them and as a result only wore them twice and went back to my KT tape instead. These are not well fitted for women or weightlifters with a larger thigh to knee to calf ratio. They might be better suited to men or runners with a lower right to knee to calf ratio. The ”MADE IN CHINA” tag is irritating and poorly designed. It's nearly impossible to remove without tearing the seam stitching and having to resew the brace. Also the pressure zones aren't differentiated enough to help with kneecap alignment or patellofemoral syndrome. The braces are also very thick and tough to wear under most clothes.,I really was hoping to love this sleeve. I injured my MCL running and chose this because all of the great reviews. However, I did not have the same experience. My measurement was in between two sizes so I ordered down as suggested. The brace squeezed my leg to where it became painful to wear around the top and it would slide down as I wore it. I contacted cambivo directly about the fit issue and they were great in sending me the size up. However, the larger size was way too loose on the bottom side and slid down even worse as I wore it. It was just too big. I would not buy this product if your measurement is exactly in between two sizes as mine is.,I've been using my Cambivo Knee sleeves for approximately one month while exercising daily following ACL injury.,The Good: Initially I found the sleeves to be comfortable and provide good support without restricting movement significantly.  I have large thighs and calves and I found these sleeves stayed in place relatively well compared with other sleeves I've tried.,The Bad:  After about 3 weeks the non-slip strip along the top of the knee sleeves began to separate from the rest of the sleeve.  Close inspection showed that the strip was only sewed on with a single stitch across the top and bottom of the strip.,Verdict:  This is an inexpensive product; it works well initially, however is poorly made and not made to last.  I will likely purchase a different sleeve once these become unusable.,My thighs go from 18 inches when I stand to 20 inches when I sit. I now have these in a medium & large. The mediums at 1st had great compression & felt good when I was standing. BUT since I spend most of my time sitting the mediums started hurting me. I took them of & they left bruising on my thighs. They even bruised my hamstring from being so tight. I came back & ordered the Large BIG mistake. The Large is just to big. So when I walk they fall down. There is zero compression. So when my knees try to murder me when I walking down the steps these braces will NOT help save me. LOL Now Im stuck with a medium that is too small & a large that is to big.,I'm rating 3 stars do to sizing. The quality of the product seems pretty good, but the sizing is off it this means to provide support. I realize that not everyone wants a very tight fitting garment, but when it comes to knee support, there is an absolute need for a snug fit. If the product fits like a sock then there will be no support. That said, I've used other brands of knee supports in a size small from sporting goods stores with good results. I am 5 ft 8 inches and a fit build and this size small was too large to provide any sort of snug support. I realize some people may read this and think that maybe it's my leg that was too small. However as I said, I've used size small in name brand supports with great results. Take from the review what you will.,For reference, I'm 4'11, 135 lbs in the attached photos. My leg measured 20"" around the thigh and 14.5"" around the knee. Going off the size chart, a large should have worked, but it was simultaneously too tight and too loose.,The area around the knee felt ""loose""; there zero compression going on. Sizing down is out of the question because the top band was too tight and pinched the skin.,This sleeve might work for you if your upper leg isn't much wider than your knee, but even then, the silicone band around the top makes it less stretchy than the rest of it. It was completely fine around my calf, FWIW.,I’m not a small girl. And I’m not that large either. But I need knee support. I ordered XXL because usually they are too small. I order these because in the picture, it shows them to be nice and long. The ones I’ve had in the past were too short, cutting off my circulation right above my knee. It rolled down and was super uncomfortable. If it was as pictured, longer by two inches as pictured, I wouldn’t be returning it right now. You get what you pay for"
"I purchased this brace because I'm having arthroscopic surgery for a meniscus tear in two weeks and needed something to give support and stability while at work.  The brace feels good on my knee and gives good support.  My knee doesn't seem to catch like it does when I'm not wearing anything.  I have large thighs and the 2XL is a good fit.  The problem with the brace is it wants to roll down. The first day wasn't too bad but the second day it rolled down even more while I was wearing a sundress.  Normally I would return the product but I think under my work pants it won't be a problem. I will overlook that considering you get two for a low price and I won't be using them long term.  Maybe customers with small thighs won't  encounter this problem.,Well I ordered a small and when compared to other brands, their small is basically a medium. Due to the size issue very little support provided for my knee. The neoprene/silicone upper and lower lips do provide excellent grip but unfortunately the material causes me to develop a rash/scratching reaction that can last for several days even after stopping usage.,I will keep as not worth the effort to return.,I am a size 10 in pants, usually wear a small-medium in tops. Based on the measurement, I should have ordered a large. I was skeptical because any time I have used measurement size and gone against my usual sizing of medium, it has always been too big. So I ignored the chart and ordered a medium. Well, the medium was way too tight for me. I returned and ordered a large like I should have the first time.,UPDATE: I ordered the size large and now that one is way too big. It is still tight on my thigh but no compression whatsoever on my knee. If you have thick thighs compared to the rest of your body, like me, these may not work for you after all.,The price was right and size.  But they felt like they were made with fiberglass thread, itchy, itchy.  So I washed again and more fabric softener, but no difference.,I really wanted to like the knee sleeve and purchased both a SM and MD. My knee hurts from sciatic pain and the skin is numb on one side. I thought a compression would help when I put weight on my leg, but it didn’t. Looks well make. Thick stretchy material. Good rubbery inside band to keep it from slipping, but I couldn’t keep it on long at all. I itched/tingled where it touched me but it was from the compression. I would definitely recommend or purchase again if I needed it for a knee injury or to stabilize the knee to run/work out.,Have been using a nearly identical brand for a couple of years.  Based on stated sizing guidelines on the original braces, I ordered size Large.  They fit fine until recently, when the elastic seemed to be getting a little stretched out, and the fit isn't very tight any longer.  Based on decent experience with the previous ones, and noticing that the sizing guidelines are the same for both brands, I decided to order this pair in size Medium, hoping that they would last longer before stretching out.  Unfortunately this pair ends up being almost too large right out of the package.  So I'm not very hopeful about them lasting very long before stretching out.  Decent price so I'm not going thru the hassle of returning them, but disappointed in the fit!,I am really not sure about this product.  I hurt my knee at the gym and bought these for support while I healed but was not able to wear for long periods due to kept hurting behind the back of my knee.  I did measure as instructed and purchased based on the measurement.  They stayed in place but was just too uncomfortable befind the knees.,Based on the reviews I don't know where I went wrong.  Other low reviews that I read had the same behind the knee issue.,I ordered two because the description was not clear that two came as a pair.  The first ziplocked bag I ordered contained a very dirty pair that had clearly been worn.  Both in that bag were covered, and I do mean covered with hair.  It looked like several animals had played on it except it was all around, front and back.  It used a sticky liint roller and cleaned them then put them in the washer with laundry disinfectant.  The other pair was clean so I wore them.  They slid down my legs when I walk.  I would not recommend these at all unless your leg  goes straigh up and down.  I am a curvy female and they didn't work for me.,The sleeve DOES NOT stay in place. I bought the L size because that was the recommendation based on my measurements. (My thigh is around 20"") I had also tried the M to see if it was tighter, but same results, it kept sliding down my thigh slowly. It is comfortable, however it is useless if you are going to be active. If you plan to sit or lay with this, then buy it. If not, then look somewhere else. I tried it for a few days and I couldnt get it to stay in place and didn't want to try superglue. NO recommended.,Ordered the small 6'1"", 165lbs, for support of aching knees during fitness exercise and mild/moderate strength training.  I measured before ordering and this was the recommended size. While the fit is snug and comfortable, and they stay put during exercise, it's not a compression fit and they don't provide the level of support I expected.  I plan to relegate them to everyday and walking use, and get different product.  Will see how durable they are over time."
"After wearing these braces for a couple days I developed a very itchy spot on both my upper thighs.  This area once itched becomes inflamed and is in the exact pattern of the gel material inside the knee braces. I stopped wearing them over 4 days ago and still feel the urge to itch this spot. I beleive this is due to a chemical burn rather than an allergy as would have gone away by now. I really wanted to like these braces because they provide good support and were the size I needed. I guess you get what you pay for and these are being offered at the price they are because corners are cut and the consumers health is put second to profits.,I have really liked the comfort of these knee sleeves and non irritating neoprene material. My compliant comes to the long lasting durability, after about 20 uses the stitching around the non slip top of the knee sleeve started to come unthreaded and is falling apart. My return window has closed now and i'm stuck with a pair of sleeves that is near the end of there usefulness.,I suffer from RA and trying to find good compression sleeves. I measured exactly how instructed and got 19"" and ordered the large. I am short so in real life these fit closer to 6"" or more above the knee when pulled on, not the 4"" in the measuring instructions. They are too snug at the thigh - uncomfortable and significant bulging - but fine in the knee and calf. I would have just exchanged for the XL but it would have been way too loose everywhere else. I wore them for about 20 minutes and they kept bunching behind the knee, so they are getting returned. They seem like good quality for the price and well made, but definitely not going to work. So beware if you are short in regards to measuring and may not work if you have thicker thighs.,I brought this for support my knee pain but it irritated my skin so bad above the knee. I had it on my one knee one day then next day my skin is so itch like rash above the area of the knee. I have sensitive skin and allergy sometimes but not usually got like this. Stay away this product if you have allergy skin type.,I ordered the appropriate size xxl im 6ft 285lbs 24in 4in above the knee cap. I purchased this item because i twisted my knee pretty bad and was looking for something to help with the pain. When i got them they were actually baggy, I mean 0 compression. I would recommend adjusting your size chart. And After driving to khols and returning them i went back online to reorder in a smaller size and to my dismay the price had gone up 150%! I would say the quality was good from the touch they were thicker than I expected for the price which was good. But my knee is still in pain and i don't have the compression sleeve i had to wait for.,I liked the product when I used it first and hoped (!!!) it would last at least a month. I am not sure if other customers have this problem, but the pair I received (after a few uses will not stay in place any more) keeps slipping from its placement. I have to keep adjusting as the top of the braces keep falling. Well, that does not speak well of the quality. It's an honest opinion, it may not be the same with the pair you received.,A sleeve of fabric with ZERO support! It has two bands at each end which are the only points where you actually feel any pressure, but all they do is cut off blood flow! I was looking for neoprene pressure knee sleeves, these are not it!,I ordered it hoping it will arrive as promised before my work training in Dallas but it didn't.,I just had a surgery 2 months ago to be exact and my PT wanted me to get the right size and so I did measure my leg part, 4 inches above the knee so I get a large size but it was a little bigger on my leg and I don't feel any compression on my knee. But I still use it but then after hours of using it, I started to feel itchy. So I stopped using it. But for 5 days now, I still have that rash and still feel itchy. I never had allergy on anything except alcohol(ic beverage) and ibuprofen.,I bought these to help with my knee pain, and they do help.  I was expecting a tighter fit, and they do shift/roll while using them.  When I received mine, the product packaging had already been opened and the item was partially out of the package.  There was nothing wrong with the item so I continued to use them.  But for how cheap these are they worth trying out, and if its something you like you can spend a lot more money on higher quality products.,I purchased these to help support my knees. I had been wearing them around the house only and while they slid down a touch, they were still okay. I decided to take a walk using them. Approximately 1/4 mile into the walk, I could feel them slipping. The tops had completely slid down to my knees.  Will have to try them over clothes instead of skin and see if I have the same issue."
"My measurements was between 14-18"" meaning I was in between sizes, but I got the small for better support. Once I received it, it fit a bit small but I didn't try to return it anyways. A few days later, I decided to wear them to work. I put them on before I left home, not even five minutes into it I had to yank them off at a red light which was hard. It felt like there was no circulation, and the silicone grip was burning the area even after I took them off. I already threw both packaging away so I can't return it...,PS: Return if they don't fit comfortably and stay away from them if you think you might be allergic to latex/silicone because I honestly don't know at this point.,I am on my feet a lot at work and thought this might help.,The first time I wore it was for hiking in the trails. By the end of a 4-hour hike, the back of my knees had lots of welds on both legs. It’s probably heat rash or I was sensitive to the silicon grips on the brace.,I think it’s a waste of my money because of the skin issues because of the silicon grips, it was uncomfortable when I was wearing it.,Got the small; I think it will be a good size in case of stretching.,Wish there was more support, but this feels much better than nothing.,My knees have a tendency to move willy-nilly this helps with some additional guidance.,Not my best investment but as a new runner that needed some extra support this will be a good supplement for the time being and this was a good price for two.,I liked that I was able to get it on but I disliked that it started rolling down my thighs and down over the knees and slid down my leg. So, just disappointed and I need to return it because CAMBIVO 2 Pack Knee Brace, Knee Compression Sleeve Support is to small and it does not stay in place to be an effective help for strengthening my knees.,I purchased these based on so many good reviews but for me they did not help at all. I got more compression from the generic ACE braces from Walmart then these. I even went down a size from what the measurement said I should have. They were more comfortable behind the knee while running but did not help for what I needed them for. For me they were a waste of money as now they will sit in a drawer.,I ordered the XXL, I even measured before ordering. It did not fit, it was to big and to loose. There was no compression benefit for me. Since I opened the pack and tried it on I just assume that I can not return it.,I ordered the XL as a replacement, I like the design, I just need it to fit my knee. I use this for support prior to my total knee replacement in November. I need a product that fits.,I will write a review of the XL when it gets here in two days..... I hope it fits. Bad enough to be out the cost of one pair, but worse to be out the cost of two.,Apparently although they are sized for larger people they do not function for larger people. I measured and sized them correctly. When I slid them on my leg they felt decent but they immediately started to roll down rendering them useless. They were not too big for me but the grippers they put in the upper seams do not work and it rolls. Returned it for a brace with compression and velcro.,I’d rate 1/2 star if I could. These are not true to size. They offer no support . But , I paid $16 for two knee supports.. I got what I paid for.,They run very big. I bought a large . I usually wear a l-xl with products like this. I am 6 ft 235 with big legs , these things don’t stay up. Not even after a wash.,Do not purchase .,The brace felt nice Nd had support. The problem was Nd is it continues to roll dwn Nd it's very irritating having to fix it every few sec. this would be a better product if it had more slip protection than what they have. If it would've stayed in Place I would give a higher rating but for this very reason I wouldn't purchase this item again. I'm sending mine back,I am a 5'5"" ~130lb female. According to my thigh measurements I am right in the middle of the size small. I went to put on one brace and it didn't even stay in place -- immediately slid right down my leg to my ankle. I don't have skinny thighs an I followed the size guide on the product page so...not sure what happened. Returned."
"Was training too hard and strained my knees. These were an affordable option. the fit was great, except just like any other fabric knee brace they don't stay up. They have the rubberized edging along the top, but that didn't stop them from slipping down as I was walking. I had to constantly stop to readjust. Comfortable, yes, affordable, yes, do they work as intended? No. They are ok for around the house and sitting at work, but if you need something to stay in place with a lot of movement, this is not the one for you.,I have the ns10 and now the 70. I don't really see much difference between them in compression. The band is thicker but that is all. I was hoping the whole thing would have been thicker. The whole 10 to 70 title is misleading along with no actual description of the difference on amazon or on their website. Still like the product but a little disappointing finding the same support.,Even though I measured my thigh according to the recommendation (25 muscular inches), these were tight to the point of discomfort.  Too bad, because they're otherwise nice sleeves.  I found another pair on Amazon that are true to size (look for a large O logo.),I didn't return these, instead giving them to a slightly smaller friend, who thinks they're great.  If only they came in a 3XL!,I wore this when I went for a walk/run. I have a bad knee that tends to give out a lot. I thought I would give this a try. I still had a lot of pain when I was out walking. I’m not sure it helped. I gave the extra one to my friend and she said she didn’t notice much of a difference in her pain levels. Maybe our knees weren’t meant for this type of brace. Didn’t work for either of us.,These are woven fabric so great for keeping your knee joints warm but not great for compression like neoprene sleeves are.  The are also not very durable as dove on a wood gym floor and ripped a hole in one.,If you want compression go with neoprene.  If you want to stay warm these should be fine.,Well size I measured for accuracy three times and order accordingly.,They were to big. Went on easy, but it was,not a snug fit and when I walked they both slid down my legs.,I won't be sending them back not worth my time, I will be giving them away. To bad quite attractive. When ordering I suggest one size down.,So unfortunately the Small was way too big for me. I'm 4""11 and 98 lbs and the upper part of my knee where it's supposed to rest is 14 inches around. And these fit like loose leggings on me, not any compression or support.,I can't say if these work or not but the sizing didn't work for me.,For me, these are not as firm around the knees as I would like.  I bought the right size for my thighs, but then had weak support in the knees as they fit rather loose.  Just me, you may experience something else.  They seem well made and they are comfortable, and the thigh sizing is accurate.,Opened package.....???? this mist be a kids size....ordered ""2XX""  23'-25"".....top band measured 13"" in dia.  would not easily fit over my foot.  could not ""stretch to 23""....way too tight.....tag said 2XX...must be Chinese size???,Ok I really don't understand all the hype for. Over 5k reviews for this junk. I measured as directed 4 inches above the knee cap. It keeps sliding down so that is an indication the anti slip strip does not work. It does not offer no compression or ease of pain around the knee. Very misleading product"
"If your knee was bigger than your calf and thigh, these would be great, but unfortunately your knee is smaller. This means that as you move, the bottom slides up and the top slides down. Why do they need to go half way up your thigh and halfway down your calf anyway? Compress my knee, not my knee, thigh and calf.,I'm 220 lb with 23 inch thighs. Bought these for knee pain, unfortunately they continuously roll down and do not stay up. This is problem occurs on skin contact as well as over yoga pants leggings. I admit they give me relief when on properly, but it's short lived when they roll.,This product is great quality and feels extremely well made. It’s very comfortable when you first put it on but after wearing it around the house it slid around very easily and bunches up in no time.,I tried to wear it while going in a 5 mile hike and half way through I had to remove it because it was bunching you so badly and became extremely uncomfortable. I would not recommend this product if you are looking to wear it for running or power walking.,Really bad fit if you are curly. I'm a size 12-14 and got medium because that was the closest fit but when I put it on the top part fits tight but the bottom part is too loose. Which makes them pretty useless then. Like wow ... not for girls with thick thighs. Sad.,I've tried a couple sizes and they don't make one that fits quite right, I settled for the one that's a little small because the next size up just slip down., The rubber that's meant to help keep them up is very uncomfortable against skin with hair, I fold it over but it also bunches up behind the knee which can be frustrating. That said, when combined with an ice pack sling that holds this brace in place it's OK,The top keeps slipping downward.  While it has an ""anti-slip"" design on the inside cuff, it is still slipping.  As far as performance goes, I can feel it tightens the knee and help with the pain (somewhat).  Not the best, but not the worst.  If you're only suffering from a minor pain, this might work for you.  But if you want to wear this and exercise, you'll probably need something more sturdy.,Bought based on recommended measurements listed. Unfortunately it does not hold well after a while. The bottom area towards the feet does not have a tight grip or hold on the  area below the knee. Looks decent but does not hold up well. Disappointed. I guess you pay for what you get. I would not recommend it.,I just received these a few days ago and have not worn them more than a few minutes. I ordered the XL and they are rather large. I think a size smaller might be too tight so I am going to see how they fit after a wash and dry. I ordered them in black so they will match anything I wear and they look very nice and of good quality.,I wanted so bad for these to work. Yes I measured. Yes they felt good ,looked good on and support for my Taekwondo class. But by the time I drove to my class they were rolling down. I got one use out of them and went and bought something at Walmart for my next class,I wouldn't call this knee brace as light weight.  Also, it continually slips down my leg.  The silicone squiggly line that is supposed to keep it in place doesn't work.  But, if I size down, it will cut my circulation off.  I think it would help my knee, if only it would stay in place!  Very disappointed."
"The Combiuva 2 Pack Knee Braces is ok but the compression on the knee brace is not strong enough because when wearing the knee braces walking or exercising with them they became loose between my upper and lower knee Caps. You need to add more compressions on your knee braces.,I am a disabled veteran who must wear knee sleeves. This pair arrived on time and seemed very good.,However , they fit bad. The thigh is a good fit, the lower femur part seems to wide . It does not fit below the knee tight.,Unfortunately , I tossed the package and can't return it....If they read this perhaps they can send me another pair , and I can compare. Maybe I got a bad one.,i purchased the sleeves following the measurement guide ... the sleeves doesn't seem to fit as snug as i would like them to.  i wear them when walking on the trail.. the sleeve is very flexible but again overall .. not supportive as i would like,I work out a lot and it does stay up when I move around. But it doesn't support my knees. I thought the fabric would be tighter and have more elasticity. Fabric after several use does not bounce back as much even after washing. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me.,Started having knee pains several months ago and these help even if I put them on after the pain starts.,dissappointing....too stiff & then after 3 days use stretched out and was basically useless....don't waste your money!,The knee brace didn't fit well for my calf. It was loose and bunched up by the side and back of my knee. I bought XL because I went by the size chart. Everyone's body is different.  It did have neoprene non slip on thigh though which is a good idea to keep it from falling down.,Works great in the beginning. Completely useless now. Initially these knee braces worked great and were perfect for supporting my knee (meniscus tear). However after wearing approximately 6-8 times, the braces will not stay in place. Within 15 minutes of putting the brace on it slides down my leg requiring regular adjustment. I only tried them during long walking sessions but I found that they simply do not hold up to normal use.,Despite the claim that the silicon is supposed to keep the brace from sliding down, the braces slid off completely during the first use. I've tried multiple times only to end up having to pull it back up every time. One time, it slid off so easily that it did so before I could make it out of my house. Another, I tried putting it on immediately after showering so that it wouldn't be because of dirt why it came down; it came down anyway. On the fifth attempt, the top part of the brace (the part with the silicon mind you) simply rolled down before the entire brace started sliding off.,This came a day late (I got notification that it was delivered yesterday but the actual disposition was 'delivered to agent for final delivery') and it keeps slipping down even after adjusting it (made sure to follow instructions). I might as well spend more money on a pair in XXL that has velcro straps on them."
"I have a bursa on my knee and the doctor recommended a compression sleeve to keep pressure on the knee. Well the Cambivo fits tight at the top and at the bottom but it is loose on the knee. I measured my leg 4"" above the knee like your web site suggested but its not right for my anatomy.,I was expecting a better fit to the leg. Unfortunately, the product is designed like a cylinder. It hurts my thigh and it does not offer a strong compression to the knee.,The top opening should be much wider then the middle section.,Also the bottom opening should be a bit wider.,This is a nice brace but I had to return it was just too tight around my thigh.,It’s ok... I don’t feel like it really has a ton of support and it fits tighter at the top than the bottom. I measured everything correctly for the size and got the one it said I needed, which was too big, then exchanged for a smaller size and it just feels tighter at the top with the same amount of support on the knee. I wouldn’t purchase this again.,All in all, the braces were nice and comfortable to wear initially.  Unfortunately, the rubber grip material inside caused me to have an allergic reaction (itchy red bumps on my skin following the lines of the rubber).,This knee brace works, nothing special but the title of this listing is misleading. It says 2 pack, so i thought its 2 pairs as knee braces always come in a pair and its one pair not two.,I don't know why my knees still sore when using this product for training on my leg and running. I thought it would help me to reduce the knee pain, but it doesn't at least for me. The product size is fit with my knees perfectly and really comfort. However, my knee still pain.,This product rolls down so much. I tried it on top of clothes and by itself, as you walk or run it just rolls down, therefore providing no support. Returned, if your plus size like me dont buy it. I wish I had read more into the reviews before I bought it,Quality and construction seems high but I bought the small and it still seems too big so I haven't worn it. Besides, knee pain resolved shortly after I purchased this (thanks to a tordol injection for a migraine!) so I haven't needed it.,Unfortunately the knee brace I used was too big.  I had ordered a different brand in a medium size back in March and it was too tight on my leg so I ordered a large in the Cambivo.  Since the Cambivo was a two pack my daughter tried to use the other brace on her knee that she had hurt in a fender bender.  The large fit her but as with other pull on knee braces she had tried, it hurt her sciatic nerve.  The Combivo braces were well made but just didn't work out for me or my daughter unfortunately."
"Beware! Satisfaction guarantee doesn't exist!  Item information says they guarantee your satisfaction with the product but it cost half the price of the item to return it and I sent in a concern and never got a response.  They run large and I needed a small or at most a medium, large was really big.,Bought this thinking it would be supportive during CrossFit workouts but unfortunately it is not supportive at all and have increased knee pain after use. I had part of my meniscus removed so if you are looking for comfort In that area this is not it.,It’s comfortable, easy to pull on and off. It does roll down during workouts. If you’re walking I would assume you’d be fine. But I got it for working out: lunges, squats, &tc  it always rolls down. I’m giving it an extra star for cosmetic reasons. It looks good over black tights.,This product was way to small.  I measured my leg as the size guide instructs, and ordered a size up.  Even with ordering a size up, the braces were nearly cutting off my circulation.  Needless to say, I'm returning them.  It's too bad, since the knee braces look like they're made well.,She kinda likes them. As in a little. These don't provide much in the way of support and the stock photos are brighter than the actual product. Everything is just meh. Too late to return unfortunately. If you're looking for solid knee compression/support, I might look elsewhere.,Received braces and they seem to be worn and have animal fur on it.  Definitely didn’t expect that. I’ve read and heard great things about braces. Will be returning for a NEW pair. I will make an updated review once received.,My brother loved these for work. He is walking 9 miles a day at the airport and they help his knees so much.,I’m giving low stars because they are ripping after wearing only 7 times. 😩,We are so bummed out because now we have to try and find another product that works just as good.,I’m giving 2 stars because the first time I wore them on had a small Fray Star about two hours late I went on break and noticed that it turned into a fairly large hole they do feel nice and give great support but didn’t expect the fabric to rip after a few hours of wear,Just not so great. Slid around a lot. Got two sizes too small and still moved. Feel great at first then move too much. They are comfortable didn’t really notice them till they started to move and bunch up. Constantly adjusting them,I ordered the large ones based on the sizing chart, but they were way to big. Talked to CAMBIVO customer support and they said they would send mediums. I have not received them and it has been more than a month."
"I work out 4 days a week and have only used it once.,The size I got was a small and it was ok but its way to thick of a material and it bunches in the back of the knee , would love to see one out of thinner material.,one brface was always falling down.  I found very small inside brace. one says M the other L. the L keeps falling down,ordered some time ago but would like another m and send back the l,While they are comfortable and provide some compression, they slide an awful lot when I'm doing jiu jitsu. I was right on the cusp between two sizes, so I ordered the bigger size and that was the wrong choice. Even when wearing them OVER my spats, they still slide down. Disappointing.,Good product except for the anti-slip sticky stuff on the inside which tore my leg up a bit. I'd recommend that you wear it inside out over your skin or right side out if yiu wear it over sweat pants or the like.,I used this for a short walk and found the support & compression extremely lacking to the point where the sleeves had to be constantly pulled up. For reference I measured my size at 16.5"" so the small should have been a good fit but was clearly not. Not recommended.,I ordered the size that corresponded to the measurement of my leg (followed directions explicitly: center of knee cap, 4 inches up, circumference = size) but it was too tight to wear for long periods.  I will use it, it feels supportive, but only for shorter time periods.,Size is too big. I measured my leg as the directions said and i was right at the lowest medium size so i ordered the medium. They are too loose on my legs and bunch up and dont provide much compression. I guess i should have ordered the smalls.,I do quite a bit of sitting at a desk, but I do get up and walk around equipment, then sit, then up.  I order XXL, per the measurements, but when I sit the top does curl down so I really can't use them for work, only for walking, and I think I may have gotten a size too small.,These are well made but sadly not made to fit everyone. These were a bit useless for me because they weren't nearly tight enough. For reference, I'm a size 4/26 in women's, which is small but not atypical.,Size chart inaccurate!,My knee measured as they directed was an inch below the guideline for “small”, so I ordered it. I could barely pull it over my knee. I returned and ordered the next size. Hope it’s works! I’ll review it when it arrives."
"I can still feel some relief, and I know if I could get this darned thing to stay in place I would feel much better after being on my feet for hours.  I read other reviews that the brace stayed where it was supposed to, and I was disappointed I didn't have the same results.  I am 6' tall, and even my legs are carrying extra fat on them, that is the only reason I could think of that I couldn't get the darned thing to stay in place when others could.,Update: I am still waiting on the company to contact me about replacing the item . Changed to a one star review in the meantime .,I have bilateral patella femorral syndrome and these really do help while they are in place but sadly they fall down after a short while, we ordered the right size for my measurement but they seem a little big , please if we could get a small size pair that would be amazing and a five star.,Extremely uncomfortable and the sizing chart is way off! Definitely go up like 2 or 3 sizes and maybe it’ll fit. I didn’t feel like it did anything for my knees.,The knee braces are less comfortable than I expected. The inner material used to keep the braces up sticks to your knee area in a way that's kind of uncomfortable. I don't want to give the knee braces a bad rating.  I wouldn't wear them very long at one setting.,I’m really upset by these braces. I feel like they have potential to be nice but the size chart they list is way off. I measured my leg and the chart said I should go with the XL. Well the xl is no way shape or form close to the size it says. The braces falls down when I’m just walking.,Works well but they slip down until you sweat, so you run for about a mile or two pulling them up every 2 mins before they stay up from moisture. Good support after that though. They fit fine.,These are all right but seem to run large. I am a 6' tall 235# guy with fairly big legs and these constantly need adjustments - it'd be nicer if they fit a bit tighter. I think medium would have been a better fit.,Too small!! This is one product I actually measured for because I really needed these.... According to the description it says to order a size down if you fall between, so I did. OMG they're soooo tight! I even had my husband try to stretch them for me and they wont budge. So sad! :-(,They constantly slide down the knee and give little to no support,These were great for the first few weeks. I had torn some ligaments in my knee and they gave great support while running, hiking and lifting. They were also comfortable yet secure. However, after just a few weeks they began to stretch out and sag. They are useless now as the material has just stretched out too much. I followed the instructions and hand washed but they just don’t seem to be designed for heavy use."
"if you need light support or warmth units will be ok and fit comfortably as described.,I was looking for a little more support while doing activity which these units did not provide. Return process went well.,I bought them in the recommended size for my legs, M.,You can probably get away with buying them if you are intending to use them during a normal day or a workout at the gym. They are not fit for running, as they constantly slip, making for an uncomfortable and annoying experience.,After one run they had caught some little burs and after removing them, it seems like the problem got worse and they are starting to disintegrate.,This knee brace does not have the quality I was expecting, and here are my reasons. Even with the correct size, it barely compresses the knee offering a poor knee support, which prevents recovery from any knee injury, such as meniscus tear or osteoarthritis. Furthermore, this knee brace is too thick, which makes unsuitable for wearing it under pants. Overall, I am very dissapointed with this product, as its performance is far from being what Cambivo advertises. I am requesting my money back.,It's seems like a great product I measured my thigh like I read to it say 4 inches above the knee which is top measurement for large and I had read to go up a size for comfort so I did and bought the extra large and it was still tight enough to make my feet start going numb from being to tight I was sitting in chair with my legs bent I had to take off but I had no pain at all worked amazingly just to way to small,You get what you pay for. Feels like wearing a pair of socks with the foot part cut off and pulled up to your knees. Good fit but offers no compression at all. Returned item.,This product isn't made right. I bought another product in the same size. Which fit a whole lot better.,My main complaint is that it does not compress the knee when I'm playing sports or running. It keeps moving around. It's tight on the thigh and loose around the knee.,I purchased a pack of these at the beggining of the month and was excited for the arrival. I am pretty active and trying to get back into running but often experience pain in my left knee. Unfortunately, even after carefully taking measurements and following there guide lines for fit, the knee braces are too big. I will need to return for a size small. (not too thrilled about that) Once the return is made, I can give it a more fitting review if the product is deserving.,I really needed this to work !! Unfortunately I should have sized up as I have tried to wear the last few days and the top edge on the back( behind knee) tends to pinch and roll down a bit when I walk / move . I wish now I would have gotten the xxl... the amount of compression feels good around the knee but the top rolling down makes this very uncomfortable.  According to the sizing chart given , I chose the correct size . Guess I will be sending this back,I bought the size Large and even did some measurements, however, I’m a thick thighed girl and these braces SQUEEZE my thighs. I went ahead and ordered the next size up because they seem like they will work as long as I don’t loose circulation.,I got the smallest size and still it was too big and just continued to slip down which in turn did not support my knee. I've bought others abd have always had to get medium because I do have bigger thighs and calf muscles. I saw in the reviews that others say they ran bigger. But the small was still too big. I did love the fabric though seems very durable."
"Unfortunately, I had to return them. I sized up as recommended because I was between sizes and these were so tight that I couldn't wear them as they were cutting off my circulation and leaving a nasty red mark.,So I wore these and within a few minutes they started rolling down my leg, kept pulling them up and they kept going down as I walked. Also they are much shorter than what is shown in the picture.,gonna say good customer service but other then that the procuct fit and comfort all lacking no matter what size or model.. save your cash and go to a medical supply,I measured according to companies recommendation and yet the braces slide right down as soon as I take a couple steps. Feels good while on for the few seconds it stays.,UPDATE,-Got in touch with customer service and they instantly offered to ship me a size smaller for free. Great and quick service.,I really wish these had worked for me, but they were much too tight. I have large thighs and even with measuring, they just were too uncomfortable for me.,fit is terrible. item has too much material in places which causes it to fold uncomfortably as soon as it is put on. unless both suffered the same manufacturing snafu then engineering and design need to be rethought.,Ordered a medium according to the measurement chart, too big behind the knee not tight enough for support but tight on upper leg !,I didn't like the support these provided and I sent this back. I think it depends on the person's leg shape and the way the leg lines up with the knee caps and these did not work for me.,The product had an unpleasant stench to it when I opened the packaging. I ordered an XL but it ended up being too big so I had to return it. I reordered a large and it was too small.,I got these for my mom and thought it was going to have good  support and she had it one for 2days and it’s going back. She said she is still in pain and it feels like it’s doing nothing so she’s is going back to her old one she loved. Sometimes trying new things don’t work"
"Pregnancy did a number on my knees, so I bought these to help ease the pain even just a little. I did the measurements, ordered the size recommend. But they still roll down so unfortunately I can't wear them. Really bummed.,These didn't help my knee but actually made it worse. It may be the nature of my injury and not the brace but the pressure was in the wrong place and left a bruise where the elastic tightens at the top and gave no extra support around the knee cap where I need it.,I bought these in M same as another brand of knee sleeves. However, these do run a little bigger and I just didn't feel as much compression.,Was excited to receive, but after several days of use the brace does not stay up. Gathers behind knee making it uncomfortable.,Bought as a second pair to my Roxofit pair. Tried them on, not Roxofit!! Fail! Not supportive. Loose. I returned right away and bought a second pair of Roxofit.,These might work if you wear short pants, but with jeans and sweat pants they bunch up and actually hurt.,Kept falling down in the first day of wearing it.  Very good for support on knees,The sleeve fit well and compression was good. I use the braces during sports and one tore after a fall during the first use. These will last for running but do not survive impact.,I was hoping they were going to be better. They are uncomfortable and I's disappointed that there was pulls in the material.,Really want to love these, I thought I bought the wrong size one when I put on the right knee. I put on the left and it was perfect. Somehow I got two different sizes 😔. Put them nxt to each other and the right is bigger. And I actually need the support for the right knee. Which I tried them on earlier."
"At first they fit nice and tight. No movement no droop stayed in place. But after about 3 hours of moving and working they starts to fall off the knee.,I washed in hot water to see if I can shrink. Didn’t work. I used the measuring system to predict size but maybe the smaller size was needed,The middle of this brace is too loose.  I bought a size smaller than what they recommended for my size in their specifications and it provides basically no support on the middle of my knee.,I was not satisfied with this item.  Tried running with them and they just seemed to fall down on my knees, not helping with the problem.,I received these on November 1 2019 and by December 4 2019 they stopped staying up and the gell stuff around the band has just about gone.  The only good thing is they were cheap.  That should have clued me into the quality.  You get what you pay for.  Will never buy again,Fell apart in weeks. Frayed and torn. I use them in the gym 5 days a week but I do not abuse them. They also stretch.,I measured and went on the conservative side when I measured between sizes and there is ZERO compression... no support at all. Easier to put on and slide up the leg than most skinny jeans.  Otherwise if you can get the right size (size down) I'm sure they are helpful and durable.,I meausered and remeasured, still too small. Even if it had fit, it's no more supportive than a pair of yoga pants.,Idk I always have a problem with the roll down on these sleeves and in this case the same. If not active they offer pretty could support but I cant keep them from rolling down. I usually end up just taken them off after awhile or use if not active.,they don't stay up on knee as you walk. no compression at all. cheaper ones ive use work way better and they stay in place,So i like the product. My knees have always given me trouble and when i first put this product on...omg the relief. It put just enough pressure on my joint that it let some of the tension and aches go, but didnt feel like i was about to lose circulation or something. That being said, i work 12 hr shifts and im climbing stairs all day. I was constantly having to pull it back up my leg after each flight. I got a Medium and im about 5' 10"" 180lbs, so im pretty sure i didnt get a size too big. But still, fairly good product. Just have to hit it with medical tape so it wont keep sliding down"
"The support in the knee area was too loose (even though I had the right size - small).  It did not help with the pain that was constant even when not active.,These should have fit me like a glove...instead I could not get even the wide part of the sleeves even to my knee cap, let alone over it.  They are supposed to be knee sleeves, not calf sleeves.,The so called anti slide points don't work. Constantly slides down leg!  I measured for fit prior to purchase.,Addendum,I have now had these for a couple of weeks now and the fit is so bad I have blisters on my knees mainly because of them constantly sliding down.,Again, these are yet another support designed for men or else women with very straight, skinny legs. They don't stay put and roll down easily.,These are pretty pointless as I bought the recommended size but after a couple uses they stretch out and provide no support,I didn’t like how they felt at all. When they sit right it shows an ugly bulge on the thigh. Bigger would be too loose so no point in that.,I made a mistake on this review and was looking at something else.,I made this review on the wrong item !,This Item is GREAT  and has NO BAD SMELL to it.,I`m sorry guys !,Michael Workman,These are the worst. I have bought several throughout the years because I'm in my feet all day and my knees are shot. These cut off circulations and do nothing to aid in joint support.,Bunches up, no support. Waste of money.,I measured my leg (19"") and grabbed a set of Large. They fit pretty loose so they don't give much support. Better than nothing but not much better."
"I measured 4"" above the knee as directed and they were too small. They squeezed the fat on my thigh way too tight and were uncomfortable to use.,Overall I like them, but they could have been tighter on the knee itself. I ordered a medium when I normally would have got a large in order to be tighter, that helped a lot.,I like the quality of product. My dislikes are it bunches behind the knee which is uncomfortable and it tends to slide down with sitting/standing/walking movement. I feel a size smaller might be too tight so not sure how to fix problem.,This product did not stay on my legs well at all. The elastic around the edges does not hold up. It lasted for a week.,went through all the trouble of measuring my thigh and all they did was squeeze too tight and slide down my knee,They worked well for a few days then the elastic just became too weak. My injury outlasted both braces.,These braces give great support, I'll give them that. But when I got home and took them off, I had a swollen and itchy reaction and it's terrible. My skin looks like it's almost blistering, like I was attacked by ants.,These are fine but do not stay in place like other have in the past. I will likely have to buy another pair later from a different company.,Ordered Friday came Saturday 🙂.  Didn't work for me.  Measured leg, got extra large.  Put on felt great with a lot of support but as soon as I started walking it just rolled down.  Tried repositioning, but still same thing just rolls down.,Compression nice, but rolled down my leg (I bought the largest size and wear an 18/20 in pants if that helps)."
"I ordered a small, and it was still too big. It offered no compression at all. Even If it did, I would not have liked how big and clumsy it felt.,These are not tapered enough! The thigh area, is just about the same size as the shin area. Had to sew them in about 2 inches at the bottom for a comfortable fit. Otherwise they are great for the money!,Too bad about less than hoped for fit: After measuring as recommended, ordered the XL. At 5'2"" 150 lbs should have ordered L I guess - fits thigh but knee compression is virtually nonexistent. Won't be reordering.,Straight out of the package the  Stitching on the rear seem was loose and coming apart.,Had to return as it didn't hold up tight enough for Gym activities. The same size worked well with another product.,Too loose and no support, buy medium if you normally buy large size.,Measured my leg and ordered XL. They run a little loose so buy snug. They are comfortable but get bunched up and I have to adjust often. Hopefully seller can help me out.,tried many many knee braces.... same problem, slide down immediately. picture is deceiving.... not as long as pictured.,The first 10 days the sleeve worked very well, no riding or slipping.  However, since that time, the sleeve will not stay in place and slips constantly.  Disappointed that it didn't keep the elasticity, although I guess having 2 sleeves helps.  Don't know if I can wash and dry and maybe it will shrink and will fit better.,Product is very well made however I hoped it would provide mor stability. I am 6 feet 230 pounds with thick muscular legs and feel that the large I ordered are too big. I kept them but ordered mediums now as well. Stay tuned."
"Wasn't impressed. They didn't offer the support as described. The braces also kept rolling, and moving. I had to keep readjusting them. I guess I'm stuck with them now since I've worn them.,it constantly slides down. If you use this more than half an hour, you will have to move it up due to sliding. doesn't stay where it should stay.,Fits great in the beginning, wore out/got too stretched out for good compression use after a few weeks of use,They roll down, bunch up and cause problems with circulation.,Don't waste your time, effort or money.,While the product fit perfectly, it wold not stay up. It would continually roll down my leg and gather behind my knee, ultimately pinching the skin and irritating it.,Not as much support feel as I would like but they work for the mean time.,Th work great but after 2 half weeks the elasticity fails.  The product starts slipping and loses support.,In the photo they look a little longer as if they would go a little lower or higher on the leg.  The material is fine but not quite what I need.,It could use more compression/support on and around the knee and less on the thigh. The thigh held fast and a little too tight at times  while the support around my knee was too flexible and lacked the tension to keep the joint stable.  As a result, sizing down to achieve a more supportive hold on my knee would result in an uncomfortable tightness in the thigh area.,It caused a bad rash on my legs - the support was there for sure but the banding not so much -"
"I followed the steps on how to measure exactly. I wish I would have ordered a size down because I don't get the compression I was hoping for. They are comfortable but if you're looking for real compression order one size down.,The brace was very tight at the top, making it uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. My leg measurement fell well within the suggested guidelines for the correct size. I have other braces in the same size that I ordered, and this pair was much smaller in circumference at the top than the others. The rest to the brace was fine. I’m sad that these didn’t fit correctly.,These definitely run small. I followed the directions to order the correct size. I can not even use. They cut off the circulation to my lower leg and I ended up with swollen feet instead of relieved knees.,I measured exactly where the instructions said to to determine the size I would need. They are loose, bunch up, and slide down my leg after a few minutes of walking.,Kind of loose. Smaller then what the pictures look like.,It seemed good at first but it seems loose now... it’s only my second day using it,Got these for my fiancé and we followed the sizing guideline and they seem to fit him right until they slide down. Not terrible but could be better fitted to keep from moving out of place,Fits ok right around the thigh a size bigger wouldn’t support my knee. It serves it’s purpose but I’m still going to look for a better brace.,The tape doesn’t hold good and they keep rolling down as you walk. You constantly need to adjust it.,I have a knee problem and have to stand working long hours.  First try is okay, but very uncomfortable when ware longer hours, then start to have skin effect."
"These knee sleeves are pretty much like all the rest that I have bought before! Average comfort, average support, and they do slip down a lot!,I just tried these out today and they keep rolling down when I was exercising. The back pinches you when it’s down. Threading is already coming out and loose. Not very good product.,Entirely too large regardless of checking the sizes :/,I didn’t feel any compression at all. The material is too thin to feel anything. I would pass on this products.,Much to heavy material for the support it offers. wore one day slid of my knees constantly.. will be returning it this week,Great product but my wife ordered from the same listing as the first set I wore out and the new pair is a different size and design. Both small but the new ones run much bigger than the previous pair. They lasted without stretching out much for well over a year of wearing them 5 days a week at work.,Too loose. Hoping it would compress and have support. Just feels like sock material.,Too big needed a smaller size and they would have been fine,I bought the smallest size available and they are far too large to provide any support, even when worn over pants. The product seems to be quality but I would not recommend it to anyone who wears below a size 2 for pants.,Material is too stretchy and starts to roll down. Maybe get a size down"
"Measure by leg as instructed. Ordered the largest unit. It slides down. Offers no support to knee at all.,received today. Great fast delivery.  been in knee pain all week so I put it right on. wouldn't say up for 5 minutes.  Ordered according to the size chart.,If you are a fluffy man or woman with big legs, this is not for you. The brace will roll down your knee.,These don’t provide very much support. I use both braces on one knee just to get the support I was hoping for.,I listened to reviews that said it was too tight, and went up a size.  I had to send them back and re-order.,Didn't fit, had to send them back.,Its a good product but after you wear for a while the plastic bits inside start to hurt your legs,Knee brace lacks structure and is too elastic.,Porch pirates got to this package so I cannot review these braces.,These were a poor fit for my knees, it was too snug on my thigh, and not tight enough on my knees to properly support them  - items returned"
"Disappointed that it didn’t fit. I measured my lower thigh and was 22” so I ordered a large, it fit enough to stay in place but offered 0 support and wasn’t “tight” on my knee at all. Probably need a M. hard to say if it actually offers support if it were tighter, maybe? But it definitely stays in place and doesn’t need adjusting.,They have held up great when I use them at work. Though they tend to slip down over time, since I wear shorts, its not that big a deal. Wearing pants is what makes it cumbersome to readjust constantly. They were meant to last and provide adequate support,I measured just as specified but still too tight around my thigh. Good material and comfortable if not for the thigh issue.,They go on the knees ok and did not seem too tight, however after wearing for 4 hours, i had red welts around the bands that did not go away after 2 weeks. I had another brand which did not give me such problems. So I am not sure what material they use that is not good for the skin.,Ordered this based on sizing chart and its just too loose on my knee. I'd suggest going one size smaller instead of bigger to be safe.,Product didnt work for me. It has compression but I dont believe this is meant to support for arthiritis knee pain.,The first week was good they don’t go down they stayed on good after that every time I’m working out or running they slide down I got the measurements down and got the size recommend and I honestly don’t like the product for that reason I was so excited to use them but it was a disappointment,They claim this to be anti slip.. I wear these for work and I get on and off my work truck about 150-200 a day and walk a lot.. and I have to adjust these every other stop.. it gets annoying and I wish I had my old ones they worked perfectly but I wouldn’t recommend these.. they roll too! And it’s frustrating not going to buy this again,Nice idea for short term use.  Nice supportive enough for days of walking.,I purchased this item and it doesn't work for me!! Rolled down didn't stay up around the knee area at all"
"They aren't tight around the kneecap at all.  And the material is too thick.  You can barely bend your knee without the back bunching up too much.  I'm returning this,I ordered the correct measure size but the did not fit and they rolled down. Very hard to pull up and then would not stay up😳,It’s not for men/women the size S is too big for women. I’m 5,5 tall, 130 weight.,Quality is average of the product felt it getting loose after short use,These are incredibly short and heavy, not to mention way too big,Went by there chart and measured my leg ordered they were way to big,I biught the biggest ones and they were too tight on my tight. I'm disappointed.,Does not give the support I need.,Bought because of all the five star ratings, but I can give is 3 stars because does not do as described, rolls down my leg,SIZE NOT VERY CLEAR, WAY TO BIG"
"Umm its not what I imagine. The materials is not as sturdy as I thought. But will still use.,I received the product in a timely manner (thus the 2 stars), but the knee brace didn't work for me. I followed the measurement guide as directed, but they don't stay in place. At first, it was only one knee, then a few days later the other brace started folding.  I sent an email regarding my issue, but the company has yet to contact me.,This is more like a knee sock then a brace.  Almost no support or stability,Good for few uses , after that it stretches fast,if you have osteoarthritis or similar conditions this will not help you as they advertise,I ordered one pair and it was too tight. So now my second pair came and it’s the same! I will not order anything else from you,They roll down not staying in place and doesn't provide a support at all.,I haven’t worn these because they were too big and didn’t compress my knee the way the should have. If you do order these I would recommend ordering them a little smaller than what you think you need.,design is good and simple ,  but the top gel is hurting , going to return,Started to fall down leg after the 3rd time wearing"
"I returned them because they didn't fit my thighs.  Kept rolling down.,Not enough compression. I’ve measured the circumference 4 inches above the knee cap and ordered a medium for 17inches. But it feels loose.,Order two sizes smaller,Does not stay up on leg.... If anything it made my knee feel worse,I measured about 19"" so ordered M but it felt large and not snug fit. Material is good though,They were great but lasted only till 10-12 wear.  Very poor quality,I have bought several of this similar brace due to my left ligament torn history. This one is a little bit tighter than other brand. The quality is ok and price is good.,Not for bigger knees despite purchasing a large. Bulges under knee which punches.,looking at the price, you get what you paid ... quite fair product,The customer service was great, they tried to help me get the right size etc, but ultimately the product is not the best quality. after a few washes, the elastic is not as strong, it wrinkles up too much on your knee, keeps sliding etc. I ended up throwing them away."
"It's ok the product,Good support, but wouldn't last more than a couple of miles before having to be adjusted.,Does not stay up falls down,Stitching was off down center front above and below area  , definitely order a size up if at upper edge of inches for the size,not supportive and not comfortable,Measured according to the chart and I guess I need a size down [I got an XL]. I can say quality wise, it seems really sturdy but I'm not a fan of the squiggly no slip support cause they always roll down on me vs  having a thicker straight strip. I will try to return and get a L and update the review then.,My measurement is 15 by instruction so I purchased small but this is very tight and uncomfortable.,I followed the size chart and ordered the smallest size (S). This knee sleeve doesn't stay up and constantly slips down offering little to no support. I returned the product.,I used these for volleyball after undergoing meniscus surgery and ACL repair. They fit well and keep you stable but they are not durable. After one slide on the floor to reach for the ball during volleyball, the left sleeve ripped at the knee.,I gave these braces 3 stars because they appear to be well made, much better than what you would find at say Walmart.  But they actually hurt my knees because without cutouts for my knee caps there was too much presser placed on them.,If they had the knee cutouts I would try them again."
"It felt great as soon as I put it in but if you have bigger thighs then this isn’t the product for you. I’m a plus size women with thick thighs and as soon as I tried to stand up and walk it started to roll.,Nice comfortable sleeve. Did not have much, if any, actual support for the knee,These do run bigger than expected!,They are decent for the first few days I don’t know if it’s just the ones I received but there are some loose threads all of a sudden and they are no long as tight as they where when I first got them. I used them maybe about 10-12 times so far,Good support for walking but not running. . Especially if u r built with small calves and bigger thighs.. Tight on top, loose on the bottom.,The material that the sleeve is made out of is very nice, but there was practically no compression. I measured accurately and chose my size accordingly. It fits my thigh well, so my concern is if I go down a size for more compression, my thigh meats would be strangled!,Didn’t have enough support for what I wanted, needed or was expecting.,Measured before I order😔,I like that two come in the package.  I like the texture except the rubber around the inside top to prevent slipping. Although it did prevent slipping, I had an allergic reaction to the rubber.  There was itching, swelling, redness and large bumps on my thigh.  I can wear them for very short periods of time.  There is only light compression so if you’re looking for something more secure you might try something else.,Ok"
"It offers good support and is comfortable but the quality is not great. As u can see from the pictures attached it began falling apart within the first month of use and keep in mind I only use it twice weekly while working legs at the gym.,These are good but for me they are a wee bit too tight fitting. Cut off my circulation.,Good looking knee brace, but not good for obese or people with larger thighs or knees. Immediately the brace folds, doesn't stay up for nothing. Can't use.,Slide down don't do anything for me,I feel a little support but they do not stay in place.,This is just an elastic sleeve. Least support is on knee area,Fantastic product!! Stays in place and is so comfortable that you don't even know you're wearing it UNTIL you wash it. I hand washed it in cool water and suddenly the sticky band at the top, designed to keep it in place, was no longer sticky and no longer worked. It now slides down. Such a waste of money.,They fit too tight based on the chart.,Wrong size for me.,Don’t buy,  started threading within a week of purchase. I also bought the appropriate size and they were so tight to the point that they started making my lega hurt,  I bought them to help my knees and they just made them worse"
"Pic showed more of Neoprene looking brace, but this is more of an elastic cloth brace. Still worked great for the first couple uses, but stretched out pretty quickly after that.,A good bargain but I would save your money on better braces.  Even for 2 they wear out quick,Returned due to size being super big. I had ordered per the size chart (L), but when tried it on, it was very big and kept sliding down.,I bought the pink ones that were very comfortable.,These ones are too big even though I ordered the same size as the first pair.,I shouldn't give it one-star, but the sizing info lies when it tells you to size up if you are on the cusp, because they are constantly slipping down my husband's leg because their sizing chart said to size up. So now I have 2 knee supports that are useless and I wasted almost $20.,Did not stop rolling down they wouldn't stay up,Lost support after 3 weeks of use!,Nice and snug but Can lose its shape.,I used the sizing chart to order the right size and still these did not work out for me. These sleeves did not provide the right amount of compression around the knees.,After two weeks of use, the stitches started to come out. I’ve had it for a month now and they are useless."
"This brace helps a little but keeps sliding down and needs to be pulled up. Probably not the best brace for my knee. It gives me too little side support.,I measured per the instructions and ordered an X Large, now while cycling the both braces fall down. Otherwise they seem very durable and would be perfect, my suggestion measure and maybe if close get the next size down.,Disappointed.  It keeps rolling down my leg,Oversized,I suppose for the price they’re ok but they slip down over the day at work and with previous reviews of guys “in the construction trade” must have been sitting at a desk and not actually up and down all day. Would not recommend,The product is lightweight which is great, however, they do have a tendency of sliding down your legs. I was under the impression when I ordered these they were a tight fit and would for the most part not slid down my leg. I ordered a medium size as indicated for my size,Good quality, but doesn't serve a purpose. It keeps running down. returned the item,Cheap material, not good support for serious runners.,These braces are not that great.  They provide some stability in the knee,  however the braces constantly just slide down my legs when I’m working out. I do have bigger thighs so maybe that is the reason they don’t stay in place.  However I don’t recommend these.,I measured correctly, per their guide, but the top elastic band was too tight. I like the rest of the fit and the style."
"I ordered the right size but they were not tight at all. About as tight as regular leggings with minimal support. Returned.,While the top of the brace with the rubber seems to fit alright the bottom does not fit at all.,They seem to help,Too small,Good design 👍,Abit too tight,Fit well ordered an XLbut marked L, fit my friend with very swollen knee.,Buy a size up. Don’t make the same mistake I did. These are not true to size.,Size runs big,Uncomfortable and sizing is off"
"Four inches above knee measures 20”. Ordered large which follows 20” size guide.  Too large affording no support and slip down thigh immediately.,You get what you pay for. I ordered a size larger than I measured and it was still ridiculously tight. I wore it for 10 minutes and it kept siding down and bunching up behind the knee.,I developed a rash where the anti-slip silicone meets the skin.  This occurred even under normal dry/clean conditions.  Had to return the knee brace.,The grip liner and stitches came out after few uses, the material started to show up the fuzz balls as well. The grip was good, but the product have been somewhat better.,knee brace helps fine. can't complain,Measured my leg and bought the size accordingly the top fit securely on my thigh but was loose at my knee and provided no support, idk if my knees are just skinny or if these are man sized because it seems to fit my husband fine.,I liked that the fit was okay, but, the sleeves ride up and become uncomfortable when walking. They bunch up causing wrinkles and start hurting. Must adjust often. But, other than that, very helpful.  Just wished they where longer and had an open back for the wrinkling.,Unfortunately they have the same problem as all like this, they slide down your leg. On the bright side the upper band is wider and more comfortable until it slides.,To small,Did not last long."
"I had to double them to get the compression I wanted. They tend to bunch up behind the knee when walking.,Be careful buying on here, product clearly was opened.,It slides down and does not support the knee. I bought the size needed according to the advertising.,Did not fit,I searched for latex-free knee braces for my father. He is critically allergic to latex. These came up first.

Now I have to pay to return,I don't think they do anything for my workout,comfortable and it doesn't sweat too much.,Fits much larger than traditional sizing. Doesn’t provide adequate support because it’s too big. I bought a medium based on sizing recommendations and average size and should have gotten a small.,I ordered based on the measurement guidelines but could barely get it past my ankle.

"It does not hold in place and when it does, it provides little to no support. I bought another knee brace and in comparison, this does not do anything.,Was too tight,Didnt help at all. Disappointing considering all the good reviews,It’s pretty good but I this company needs an XS option as well. I bought the small and while it’s good in that it doesn’t slide and it helps with my knee pain, it’s just slightly too loose. It does the job enough but could be doing more.,Does not fit properly,As the title says, the brace developned a hole in it 3 months from purchase.,Keep in mind when selecting amoung the options.,One of the braces came apart after the first time wearing them. And no my son wasn't too big for them. He's a skinny little thing.,No noticeable much needed support,I ordered this for my husband. He has similar product so we ordered same size (small).

But it still works.,I had to keep pulling them up while playing Raquetball.,I ordered my braces according to the size chart. I read several reviews that said they come big and order a size down.

About 20 minutes into my workout, it kept slipping and rolling down,I cannot recommend this knee brace!,knew braces to tight on upper thigh and loose below,DIDN'T fit true to size,Just doesn’t really add any support to my knees which is the whole reason I needed it in the first place. Also felt like they wouldn’t last more than a few lifts.,The plastic makes my skin really itchy And tight .,Don't know why it says ""2 pack""; only one arrived in the package.

"Would not last more then 3 times wore,I measured my knees and according to the chart, medium will fit me however it is not compressed enough.  The fit range is too big.,The ease of pulling up,Ordered size as directed on the description for the knee braces and there is virtually no compression whatsoever.

"I use these for football I have pretty battered knees after 13 seasons. They tend to slide down more than anything and the threading frayed after a week of use in non contact preseason practices. It does its job just not in the most efficient way possible.,Did not work or help. Kept falling down even though I measured properly. My husband had better relief using an ace bandage than these,They did not stay up while in motion. They also rolled down at the top. The compression was perfect! Unfortunately, they’re not a match for me. I’m going to gift them to a friend!,Worked,Great!!,Not the right fit, it's too tight.,I liked the durability but it tends slide down,Slides down to the knees with physical activity; so it needs to be pulled up occasionally.,Slide down far too often,It still roll down. I am waiting to wear it more so that it will fit me with time.,I thought I needed a medium but I’m a small nice product"
"The top of the brace is almost the same size as the bottom.  If your thigh and calf are not the same size,  these will be loose at the bottom or super tight at the top.,Size S is too big and had to return,tends to loosen up with frequent use.,Runs small,Rolled off within 30 minutes,They look nice and breathe well, unfortunately they don't stay in place. They're so long that they bunch together as you walk. I actually ordered mine a little small, as I was on the border of two sizes, and they still don't stay in place. It's a shame.,Didnt fit above my knee rolled down to lose below my knees i couldnt use it,Too tight at the top and not enough support on my knee where I need it.  I did like that i was able to wear it under my slacks, but just not enough support.,Work as expected.,I ordered the extra large.,I need a large size.,I will return this week ."
"They do not stay in place very well, constantly pulling them up.,Product seems like good quality but just does not stay in place. Even when just sitting or walking, product slides down my leg and bunches up around knee area.,Get 1 size smaller, they were falling off and not as compressive as I thought they would be.,They don't stay in place on knees.,Too bulky,Bunch up after a short while, despite the right fit measurement,The will not stay in place when you move you have to sit still (no walking) when you wearing them,I ordered a small and got large. I really needed these asap and now I have to go thru the hassle. Of returning and replacing them.,I don't like that it is too tight above knees and kind of stops blood circulation.,Very well built and performs great, supports well and very flexible"
"The slip down and have to be readjusted ever 10 minutes and they fit tight,Not satisfied with item..Keeps sliding down my knees when I run and compression wasn't felt...,These really don't have to support that I need...I got a size large.  Not sure if I should go down a size or just return,I measured and bought the appropriate size but it still rolls down with simply walking.,Tighter than it supposed to for the correct measured size. I can feel the blood trapped in my lower leg when running. Had to remove it in the middle of a run.,very tight and painful,The braces keeps rolling down once I put them on my knee, their very uncomfortable to keep on,over all the knee support is fair, it drops  down under knee when exercising on just in regular use in the course of the day,Its a good sleeve. My only issue with it is that the sleeve keeps folding over from the top.,Excellent at first but stretched out quickly and keeps falling down."
"Little or no support.,ok,Got a large but it was too big. A medium would have probably worked better.,These fitted well for the first 3 months then started to slip down. Now they dont stay up after about 30 mins when they used to stay up all day.,Did not hold on place,Liked how it stayed in place with the rubber strip around the top. However I felt I get better support from a simple wrap with an ace bandage.,If I wanted something that weak I would cut off the end of my socks and pull them up,Too tight at thigh.,Not a whole lot of support.,Doesn't stay up keep falling down"
"Product size was too big, I recommend a size smaller just to get the right fit.,It does not stay in place. Used it while walking and the darn thing was on my shin.,I purchased the knee braces based on the fact, they would not slide down my leg during workout or just walking.  after the second day of wearing the braces they will not stay up I am constantly pulling them up! So annoying.,More knee support,They were to small.  I sent them back,Doesn’t stay up,Doesn't provide enough support or compression to the knees.,No era el tamaño correcto y creo q estaban sucias se las regalé a mi vecino,too small,My braces are too small.  I like to exchange for a larger size. I emailed Cambivo to the email listed on the product.  It was returned.  Still need to exchange."
"The quality of the product is good but the fit is not good.,I don't like that it isn't very supportive.,The brace was not tight enough and there is no ability to tighten it.,Great price... Great fot too! Until u sweat in them 3 times and they stretch out,Size is too big,Unfortunately it does not give enough compression. Maybe a smaller size would have been better.,came unsew first time woren,Good knee brace, but rolls down within short time.,Brace would not stay in place.,Too small."
"Got these for hiking. Offered no support and just bunched up around the knee. Measured where I was told to measure and got the correct size. Will be returned.,Does not stay in place and support is not that great,Uncomfortable. Offered no support,As soon as you star sweating they will slide down.  Not for me,They don’t fit tight,Doesn't really support tried 2 different sizes.,good,Wrong size for me,Should have returned one was much larger than the other.  (,Finally received goods, really be disappointed, what I order was S, but received goods indeed are L，I am to live the abroad, exchanging the goods is troublesome matters"
"Super comfortable but always slides down and not enough support.,Pequeñas,I spent 10 hours wearing Cambivo knee supports. I was working on a scaffold where I had to bend a lot.  No ill effects so far more work tomorrow,.,Been using it since 2 months. The quality is cheap, now elastic is not holding as before.,They don stay in place,Werent supportive enough but were comfortable,The product is good is true to the size.,After using 3-4 times I started seeing stiches comming off. Not feeling much difference with my Knee pain Still I feel the sameway even when I put on my Knee Brace.,HUGE. I ordered size large. These are about 2 sizes too big. Looks like built for sumo wrestler... lol,It is not good always fell down  i want retun how i do???????"
"They have good support but after about one to two months they start slipping down and eventually have to pulled up constantly.,Doesn’t fit as expected,,Didn’t fit,Product is damaged in month.. very disappointed,Product bunches behind the knee.,Knee,I returned them because they didn't fit right.,No me agrado q se me bajan,Too tight above the knee. Too loose everywhere else. Made well. Just not for me.,I liked them"
"Like it,Nice  help a lot,Too small and tight for xl. size,And opened and with dog hair on it smh,Feels very lose when running,Item bunched up behind an in front of the knee and required constant adjusting,more big  is not size :-(,It gives me a bad allergy,Sizing is bigger than normal knee braces/sleeves.  I would recommend you size down a size....  will be exchanging mine!,Within 2wks the elasticity of the knee brace got very loose,the brace would slide off my knees"
"They’re a bit stiff,i purchased the xl. it was big enough but the material cuts into the back of my calf. However the fit is snug and relieves pressure on my knee.,The sizes are uncertain mine doesn’t fit as good,support was not sufficient.,It’s a good item I got the wrong size but it seems like a great product,Love the material, however they rolled down on me when I got into my workout...which sucks😕,Rolls down,I liked the braces but yet have I found any that doesn’t roll off the knee. I can’t keep them up!,ordered x-lg... I should have gotten large just to compare the fit difference,excercising"
"Porq ya no llego mi pedido y ni el reembolso,After a couple of wears ,they lost their support. I didn't feel that  they helped me very much.,I wish i could get my money back,I only received 1 brace,it was not large enough, too tight.,keeps rolling down.,They Slide Down your Leg.,rolls when knee is bent,Good support but sizing isn't right. Measured like it said but too tight above knee,bought one size big and will loose $5.99 to return."
"Shrinking very quickly,Braces are loose and the bottom of brace does not fit properly,I like that it felt comfortable. It runs a little big So i am sending back.,Well made, but do not offer much support,Slipped non stop. Horrible brace,A little too big for me. The material is ok,they area little to large, do not give enough support,It bunches up behind the knee joint.,They didn't fit, they rolled down exactly what I didn't  want to happen.,If I could give it 0 star, I totally would.,The rubber band on the inside gave me rashes.,I always all brand new clothing before I put them on, even socks. So I washed these knee braces with soap when I first received them.,Today, I put them on before I went for my usual 30minute run. After 15 minutes, I started to feel a band of heat on my thighs and the braces felt much tighter than when I first started running. So I had to cut it short and went home.,I took everything off in the bathroom and saw 2 rings of rashes where the inside rubber band of the braces touched my skin.,The braces are now in the garbage bin.,I would like everyone to know about this and be cautious with the CAMBIVO products."
"Just a touch to big and they slide down,Didn’t like the fit. Not enough support.,I’ll update my review after I use the product but I wanted to share this because it’s actually disgusting. Inside of the package, in the sealed bag that the sleeves come in (and oddly enough on the paper that says to let them know if I’m not 100% satisfied) was a (most likely dead) slug. And I’m incredibly grossed out.,unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!,It works but somehow it gave me a bad rash that took a week to heal. I am now 😱  scared to use it. I may give it to my brother-in-law. 😇,I wore it as I had other elastic products but, I started to experience pain and swelling in my calf. And so being afraid of a clot forming stopped wearing it. I believe they need to adjust their sizing chart.,must been a size too big, they kept falling off my knee,Just did start using this and so far so good...,not good as expected,Elastic bands irritated my skin. Other than that it's ok."
"I ended up returning these. I found that they were too tight around the top border and too loose around the knee to provide any kind of real support. They are stated to prevent sliding by having a plastic lining at the top and bottom edges. I found that this really didn't prevent sliding at all but was a little uncomfortable. I lift and so I have a definite taper in circumference from the lower portion of my quad to my knee. With even minimal movement the top band started to roll down on itself. It would not have withstood any kind of vigorous movement. On the plus side it was a very easy hassle-free return.,Not great for petite women. I’ve had other compression sleeves which I have loved and this one doesn’t come close. It’s barely even tight enough to be considered compressing anything. Did some squats and felt just as much pain as I would have without them because they just weren’t tight enough at my knee area. I think they are well made and like the rubber ends to keep it from slipping, but overall it just isn’t right for someone of my size.,The knee braces ripped the 1st time I used them. There is a large rip in both knees. I am disappointed  with the quality of this product and was expecting them to hold up.,Tried to contact the company no reply,I ordered the size exactly as recommended but it only fit at the top. From the other end I could fit several fingers around it. Because of this it wouldn't stay in place and just kept on sliding. The other problem was that I didn't feel any support to it. That's probably because it didn't fit though. It was hot too. I returned it.,I previously purchased this model knee brace and really liked them. They had good support and stayed in place. They we’re getting a little beat up from use so I ordered another pair.,Unfortunately the new pair does not stay in place. They bunch up behind the knees which is annoying when walking. I Measured correctly as the new pair is the same as the old pair.  Not sure if they were mislabeled, but regardless, these did not work for me.,I was real excited about the possibilities with this brace.  Unfortunately I was quickly disappointed.  It honestly did nothing for me.  I tried using them on a recent jog.  I didn’t feel any additional support or stability.  I don’t understand how it received such a great review.,These work alright. It feels more like a sweater for your knees rather than true compression. This item seemed to run a little large.,I will be returning these to try and find something that will give me a little more compression.,Bought them and tried to love them but they kept sliding down .  I bought the right size so that’s not the issue.  They just aren’t designed to stay up.,I only started using them about 2 weeks ago, the comfort and quality are decent, however within 2 weeks of use I had this much lose line and a hole. I would give this a 5 star when they are usable, but the durability is pretty bad, I will not recommend.,I bought a large they are to big gave them to mom."
"I like the fitting of the item, but I had a skin reaction on the band!! It’s itchy as hell!!,Brace is good except the top part above the knee started sliding down. I used it just a couple of times and now it has become unusable as it needs to be pulled up a lot of times. May be I received a defective piece, but will be looking for other options.,this was a good product but it did not fit me. i am 310 pounds.,Size"
