review
"I am of average size and this brace was way too small for me. Had to return.,Had to return without trying out as I noticed a silicone grip strip inside the brace.  Bought these because no where did it mention it had the silicone strip. Had just returned another knee brace after having an allergic reaction rash develop from the silicone in that one.,If you are looking for a slim design knee brace with good range of motion, this is not it.  It feels huge when you put it on, there are no real directions stating where the straps should wrap and it rubs the back of your knee.,I have been testing a collection of knee supports.  This one has potential but the straps land right at the back of my knee, painful. I also had to order larger due to swelling around my knee. It also causes pain if it creeps up near my kneecap. In warm weather it is really uncomfortable as it doesn't breathe.  It's also bulky, but most supports are unless it's a compression sleeve type - which may not be as supportive as this one.,I'm going to keep this as a back-up during times of injury when I need moderate support. It's not as uncomfortable as the full knee support my ortho gave me.  This can work if I fidde with it, but it won't be very comfortable.  I will use a sleeve, KT tape or the Futura Precision Comfort instead.,At age 66 I planned a ski trip for the first time in 30 years.  Most told me I was crazy, that I would get hurt.  I confided some doubt as to how well my knees would be for strength to one buddy is skies on bad knees, and he recommended I wear knee braces though he didn't specify which one.  I chose this brace.  I thought it was a pair but its only one.  But I wore the one and thought I'd see how that knee performed in comparison to the knee with no brace.  The braces knee quickly became quite painful, and escalated to more than I cared to endure.  So I loosened the brace and went for a few more runs but the pain remained.  So I took the brace off and finished the day with no knee pain.  So for athletic purposes this brace didnt work, at least for me.  The day had a happy ending though, because I never took my first fall until 2 hours in, and no injuries, and had fabulously fun day with a best friend in great winter weather.  If I can stay in the sport until age 70 I get free lift passes.  Heyyyyyy.,I purchased this while I recover from a knee injury as my previous brace was making things worse.,I like that the velcro that goes in the bad doesn't hurt the skin if you don't get the flaps aligned just right.  It does a great job at keeping my kneecap in place.,I love how adjustable this is so I was able to get the right amount of compression support.  My pain level went down a lot while using it.  I've had it less than a week and I've noticed that the straps are getting stretched out, no big deal, I just wrap it around a little more.,But unfortunately, now I feel it loosening up as the day progresses so after a few hours it starts to slide around.  I really don't like that it won't stay in place anymore which is why I can't rate it 5 stars but it still does a better job than the other 3 braces I tried.,Awesome customer service. I wore the brace at work where I'm on my feet all day and it dug into the back of my leg. Very painful but I needed the support where as I didn't have my other brace to put on so I dealt with the pain. I'm sure with someone with smaller legs it will fit perfect. I had a knee dislocation 2 1/2 years ago. So im trying to lose the weight I gained while it was healing.,I have issues with an IT band in my right leg- and this brace was AWESOME in providing support, hence no irritation during work out routine.  HOWEVER, it did not hold up...the gel ""knee guard"" (circular gel insert) has come apart leaving the gel ring exposed- I feel like the days I will be able to use further are limited.  It is a shame I don't have the option to return/exchange at this point.,I've been looking for a brace for my knee since my ortho told me I have osteo-arthritis.  I bought from a different vendor, but the fit was way too snug.  So I thought this ""one size fits all"" approach might work better.  I misread or misinterpreted the description and thought this weighed 4 oz, but when I got it and weighed it, found it was 8.  So much heavier than I was looking for.  The four straps were very difficult (for me) to get comfortable with, and with the additional weight realized that a) I'd not be able to run with these and b) it would be difficult to wear under work clothes if I just decided to use if for that purpose.  So candidly I returned it.  I'm sure it is a good product, but it wasn't what I was looking for.,Purchased this item to replace several of my old (neoprene) type of knee braces because of the really good reviews.  After using it for the past few weeks for various types of martial arts training, my current opinion is that it is “ok.”  It does stabilize the knee better but at the cost of range of motion.  It also still slips off the knee alittle (although after some rigorous BJJ rolling on a mat) which I hoped the extra straps would prevent.,Have had other less expensive braces in the past which overall achieved similar outcomes."
"I got this hoping it would offer support and comfort while I was in my aerobics classes. There is a metal (I think) bar inside that is supposed to provide support, but it did nothing but cause discomfort where it was digging into the side of my knee. I took it off to inspect, and there was nothing protruding, but when I put it on was extremely uncomfortable. I am returning this product.,Also - yes, it is green and black, but that was what I was expecting from the images shown online.,Might work better for others with different knee issues and level of pain. For me, it's okay but was uncomfortable for me regardless of adjustments. I've utterly destroyed meniscus in both knees since teenaged years and am familiar with all potions, lotions, braces, etc... What still works best for me to support the knees and reduce the ache is the compression sleeves. I also have a decades-old Cramer knee sleeve that's held up and is comfortable. I'll give this brace another shot but doubt it'll be my turn-to.,I 'tweaked' my knee a month ago and refused to acknowledge that it hurt. Stupid me. It got to the point where ice, elevation and a compression sleeve weren't helping. My doc told me to order a 'real' knee brace. After reviewing options, I chose this one.,The good news is that it does stabilize my knee well, and gives it a chance to relax a bit. I can easily bend it and 'walk' (read ""hobble"" with crutches).,The problem is that after wearing it for a few hours, my knee pain ends up worse than when I started. It's the opening for the kneecap. Maybe it's just me, but it fits so closely to that particular bone that every time I take a step, the edge of the brace presses down on the top of my kneecap and it's not long before it hurts like blazes.,Now, I'm not wearing the brace unless I know I'm going to be sitting down for an extended period.,Very uncomfortable. Does not stay put.,I am really surprised by  all the high ratings for this product. I am 60 years, an avid runner, biker and sports enthusiast. I hurt my knee recently and went with this brace based on the reviews. I needed some good support for the gym and working out. I realized right out of the box that the material and Velcro’s system would not hold up to a 3 - 4 time a week running and workouts. It’s very minimal gripping surface and a small Velcro patch that just did not feel secure enough or substantial enough. I suppose for walking and non vigorous activity it would be fine. It is very flexible and lightweight as advertised and easy to put on and off. Just simply not for me.,If you reason for using this is that you have bone degeneration in your back and hip, you may want to think this through again.  In order to be able to use this device, you need a very flexible back to be able to bend over to put this device on.  If you have fused disks in your back, this may not be possible and require the assistance of a second person.,This is NOT an all day device either.  Within a short amount of time this becomes hot and uncomfortable.,While this may work for some people, it is not something that I would recommend.,I like the support it gives me most the time when I run.  I only have two issues with it.  Some times it does slide down and it also pinches the back of my leg a lot.  Both of which cause a problem for me because I put it on when I go walking and jogging. Sometimes I have to stop my run to fix it.  You can’t really use it just to lounge in...it was a struggle putting my shoes on with the brace. And sitting down with my knee bent just crumpled up the brace.  I got it due to onset arthritis in my knee and It helps with the pain when I work out.,The product is an example of why ‘one size fits all’ is typically not true. It is bulky, and with the straps adjusted according to the instructions, it still slipped. In order to stop the slippage, I had to pull the straps really tight—to the point that it restricted my circulation.  I purchased it to wear when I use the elliptical machine, but it was uncomfortable during a basic fitness walk on level pavement.,The Velcro on the green straps seemed flimsy, such that I don’t think it would have held up if I had been able to use it on the elliptical.  It actually made my knee pain which is mild to moderate, and transient, worse. I returned it, and would not recommend it.,Bought this product to support my undiagnosed runners knee. I planned to use it while working out (floor weights, rowing, running). Not even 10 minutes into the workout, I removed the brace. On the rower, the brace was bulky and hurt the tendons behind my knee. On the tread, it provided little to no support and my knee still bothered me as it would without the brace. Returning this item,I wanted a knee brace to help support my leg after and injury. All this did was put pressure on my knee cap, it binds at the back of the knee which is very uncomfortable. It doesn't give the support I need for the inside of my knee.  The wrap is too flexible which does not give much support. To get the support out of this knee brace/wrap you have to bind it very tightly which cuts off circulation. The straps bind over the knee which puts pressure on the knee cap causing pain. The gel pad is the problem. The opening for the knee cap is too small, and the gel pad puts pressure on the top and bottom of the knee cap causing a great deal of pain.  I ordered the wrong kind of brace for my knee injury. Be  aware that it does hold in place but is uncomfortable. Order the right product for you, I didn't."
"The sizing appears to be off. I'm well within the range of the idea sizing for this product, but I still found the support lacking. For those with legs on the smaller end of the scale, the velcro straps are too awkward to get a strong fit and end up overlapping. The velcro is only on a portion of the strap, and I really needed it to go maybe another 1.5 inches down to be able to grip in the right spot.,Would be great for someone on the higher half of the sizing scale, but just not for me.,I didn't like the gel circle around the kneecap.  Made my knee hurt worse.  The straps hold it in place very well but couldn't adjust it so it would be snug enough but not too snug.  The hard circle at the knee also looks odd under workout pants!  Sent it back,This product gives me good support walking up and down the stairs. I can't feel my knee grinding when I wear it. But it is uncomfortable to wear and difficult to put on.  It also rides down some when I walk. I cannot seem to get the straps tight enough to prevent this.,The brace works good and the non slip band works great. It provides very good support. The only reason I couldn’t give it a 5 star review is the Velcro gives our quickly and it only lasted about 2 months before I couldn’t use it anymore.,Ugh, I tried several different ways of putting it on, and followed the instructions carefully. But it still slipped out of position ALL the time when I was on the elliptical machine at the gym, and even while I was walking. I tried tightening it, which did help it stay in place, but then I felt my circulation being cut off. Not a fan of this knee brace at all!,I bought this product because my son has Osgood Schlatrer disease. He needs good knee support. I typed in Osgood Schlatrer disease and up cake this one. However it’s too big for the kids knee, and Osgood Schlatrer is a kids disease... so I don’t know why this adult brace came up. I will keep it, because he’s in pain and it helps. But it’s not a child’s brace.,Helped my pain, but half way through my run, the top slides down. I have to stop quite a bit to pull it back up. Ordered according to the size chart. Tried tightening and loosening, nothing helps. I'd return if I could but it's been used. I recommend an IT band if you have runner's knee or sharp pains down the outside of your knee with a lot of activity.,This brace is generally terrible. Sorry to say if you have a leg bigger than a 12 year old you’re wasting your time with this. It narrowly met in the back, and then the straps had to be pulled so tight to get them around where they needed to be fastened that it caused massive pain and cut off circulation.,This brace looks great and I'm sure would do its job, but there is an opening in the back and the way the straps criss-cross over that opening causes me chaffing pain from the roughness of the straps.  I wish I had returned it as I can't wear it as is.  I'm trying to think of how I can ""fix"" it (cover the straps, or cover the hole).,It seemed okay at first. Then it started to pinch the skin behind my knee. I tried to adjust the brace many times thinking I had done something wrong. Nope. Same issue. Then I used a compression sleeve to protect the skin, but it was still pinching and painful. Still I tried. That is until one of the Velcro tabs of a cross strap ripped right off. Poorly made. I’m 5’2” and 117. So it’s not like I’m trying to strap it around a large leg. Very disappointed. And of course, the warranty ran out just days ago. My advice, don’t bother!"
"At first I was very impressed with the instant relief from knee pain. But then as I started to walk around it become very uncomfortable to wear as it would slip out of place. Also it doesn’t account for your patella moving around as you more your leg so the hole kind of forces it to stay in place which is also uncomfortable. It feels unnecessarily bulky and ugly so it’s not easy to hide!,Product arrived nicely packed, item as described, the issue I had was that it did not provide any support or stabilization. The gel pads do feel nice but for me someone who suffers from Patellofemoral pain syndrome this brace did absolutely nothing. when I purchase this it was mainly to have something support my knee while I exercise,  but it's quite bulky so definitely not a practical brace to wear for physical activity such as exercising. Also the way back straps with velcro are set up to hold up on the leg can be quite uncomfortable. My leg became sweaty after wearing this for about 30mins (again during exercising). The product seems to be pretty well made but it just does not do the job for me, it just felt like I had something over my knee with no purpose on it. Maybe it'll work for you.,Prior reviews were misleading.  This wasn’t very good design for a knee brace at all.  It keeps sliding down my leg.  The way the straps hold on is awkward and uncomfortable.  It makes the leg feel stiff and the straps rub.  Lastly I don’t feel the knee cap support is any more effective compared to a cheap ace wrap.,I bought two less than six months ago and they were great initially.  Unfortunately the Velcro has already lost its ability to stay put.  The cross straps have regular Velcro “hook end” pads but the brace material to which you attach them is not standard Velcro “loop” material and has worn out.  The straps that go around the back of the leg have plastic backed Velcro type material but have exhibited same issue.  Bottom line is that both braces are coming undone during use.  I don’t recommend purchase unless you’re okay with tossing them into the trash after six months.  BTW - no cleaning or care instructions were provided.  I have hand-washed and air-dried both every two months or so since I was afraid of wrecking the Velcro.,Not as comfortable as to what I read based on reviews,I really didn't like this brace.  The first time I tried it, it hurt my knee more than running without it.  I tried it tight, medium, and kind of loose.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  I tried just using tape while I was playing tennis and helped a lot.  I got a petella knee strap today and I'm going to try that next.,Reading the reviews I thought this would be an amazing knee brace but all in all, it’s just ok. There is nothing special about it, the side stabilizers did not seem to do much and I had to constantly retighten the brace every few minutes. I feel like a knee compression sleeve would have done better for me.,Good support but not very comfortable according to my son. I bought this for him to use after dislocating his knee and it gave good support but was not comfortable for him to wear and he dislikes wearing it. Had to buy another one for him to wear instead that was more comfortable but still gave good support.,I bought this after I injured my knee mountain biking. The brace is large and so stiff that I could barely walk with it in, let alone use it for support while exercising. I purchased one from another brand and was very happy with that one.,A couple of months ago I began having knee pain while running. After some research I believe it has something to do with patella tracking, but I haven’t been able to see a doctor yet. While I’m waiting on that I decided to try out this brace. Unfortunately, the top part starts riding down immediately after I start moving and by the end of my run it looks like it does in the photo. No support whatsoever for my patella. I’ll be returning this."
"The brace has an opening behind the knee, this prevents bunching with knee flexion. Problem with the design is that the elastic straps cross in that opening, as a result the edges of those straps dig into the skin. This make for a very uncomforatble situation, and results in the brace being unwearable.,My husband walks some and he needed the support.  But he also sits a lot at his job and it put too much pressure behind his knee and left marks on skin.  I tried to make it looser, but it still done the same thing.  But my husband is 78 yrs old, so skin is delicate.  For a younger person it may work better.,Bought these for my weak knees since giving birth to my now 7 month twins. The pregnancy plus constant bouncing took a toll! These were awesome when my knees just couldn’t take anymore. BUT they make it difficult to get up and down off of the floor with my busy babes and after a while they start to rub at the skin. I wear them when I absolutely need to but not a great every day product.,Impossible to get it not to gap. I’m thin but not that thin. I tried many times to use it, many configurations of straps and in the end there were alway gaps at the proximal end.,I ordered this after reading reviews online. I could never find a way to make it comfortable on my knee. The green straps either crossed across my knee cap adding unwanted pressure, or they crossed across the back of my knee making it very uncomfortable to wear. The initial imagery showed these straps running under the knee cap on the front of the brace, however my straps were sewn in such a way that this doesn’t work.,I have been using a shock doctor 870 with no problems.,Update: I was contacted by the seller and received a full refund, so now they get two stars instead of one.,This thing is very sturdy and stabilizing. It did not work for me though as the pressure it put on me was right on the spot where my meniscus is causing swelling. Was to painful to wear for any length of time. I will keep it in case of a different knee injury in the future.,Advertised fit was incorrect. The straps are too long to provide support and there was ZERO support. Sending back.,I think this brace is great quality, sturdy yet flexible, and provides the support I needed.  It’s the right size, but the straps are pinching the back of my knee like crazy no matter how I adjust them.  Will have to return it and back to the drawing board.,Seems like a well made brace and should be very good for walking. However, it is not appropriate for cycling as it restricts motion for full leg extension.  Also the behind-the-knee straps would be irritating with increased pedal revolutions.,This was comfortable and helped me with support.  However, it was not what I needed.  I needed more structure."
"will not buy this again, by the time it gets here I may be dead.  I'd give it zero stars but the system won't let me.,I like the support this brace provides. I like that the straps are secured in front. I do not like the way this brace shifts due to its design and where the velcro fasteners end up being connected causing it to bunch up behind my knee. The straps do not stay in place due to it bunching up.,The top strap has lost its hold in only 1 month. Stiching around center hole has came undone causing a hole.,The product worked fine the first time I used it. Good support, maybe a little hard to put on and some discomfort if strapped in correctly, specifically the two auxiliary straps cut into the back of my knee when strapped incorrectly. But I’ve been wearing it for about a week now and Velcro on the main straps is losing a lot of its grip. I was playing a flag football game yesterday and it basically got unhooked every time I ran. So I’d say better for non active support, walking etc.,I don’t like the way it wraps around the back of my knee. With my injury I have too much pain there,This product worked great when I first got it.  For the last month, it does not stay in place.  It constantly slides down to the top of my foot and I have to remove it and place it at my knee again.  After a few days of this, I started looking for a replacement product.  My opinion is do not buy.,He cannot use it. That doesn’t mean it’s bad. We bought one from Amazon that had straps and just pulled up, that is what helped him get support so much. This one we just have not been able to get comfortable on his leg. Others might like being able to adjust it but it wasn’t for us. Thank you.,Didn't stay up so I would constantly have to pull it back up.,It was good at first, but thuscthird world Velcro-like hook and loop is so cheap, it won't last long. It's very annoying, because the support is great, but not when it in books...all the time.,Just not supportive enough.  I am a carpenter and after an hour of work this brace has moved out of the comfortable spot and feels like it constantly needs adjusting.  The other brace i bought doesn't do that."
"Horrible fit. I put it on and when I stood up it squished down and actually pushed my knee cap. No stability in the knee cap ring and it got bunchy in the front. Waste of money.,I ordered this for my knee pain. I intended to use this for my workouts however it is a lot bigger than pictured. It is very thick and runs big. I was expecting something more lightweight thinner smaller however I do not recommend using this for workouts. You may be able to use this for other activities such as walking errands etc.,Velcro on straps are on the wrong side!,Can not go to the back and then front!,Only works from front to back!!,Which then covers the knee cap!,Worked for a little bit of time. After more than a couple months it just stretched to the point where I could no longer velcro it onto itself and the areas I'd been using weren't able to hold the velcro anymore so the straps would snap off. Once the straps got too stretched and I couldn't tighten it enough the brace would slip.,Overall this does it’s job. When standing not moving a lot it is great. However my problems come from someone who walks around a lot for work. I did not realize the four straps end up on the back/inside of the knee. The velcro pull the hair and the straps dig into the skin and it become very uncomfortable. I had to get a compression sleeve to wear under it. The overall performance of the brace is great, my 3 stars simply reflect the comfort level.,It was bulky and heavy I need to return it,Do not buy this product if you need a lot of support I didn’t know how much support I needed until after I bought this product but I would say it’s a very good product for someone who needs something all day every day and doesn’t need a lot of support,I had the same brace before and it came in medium and large. I owned a medium and it was great,. Good support, didn't slip, good motion.  The velcro on the main connectors wore out, so I thought to order a new one, not realizing this one was much bigger. I can not get it tight enough around my leg (especially bottom part) and I don't have small legs. It's bulky in the back of the knee because of that and it irritates.,Too bad they do not sell the medium size anymore.,When you make it tight enough to be supportive, it creates a calf cramp. I found myself adjusting it while running because it shifts. Too thick behind the knee. Admittedly helped more than my elastic pull-on brace.,I have been using Ace supports for my arthritic knee and thought I would try this one.  Not too happy with it.  They are comparatively hard to put on and don't seem to work as well."
"Wrong size!!!,I think it has too much range of motion and there is very limited stabilization from this brace. If stability is what you need this brace is not what you are looking for. So if you have meniscus issues keep looking because this wont help you.,Too bulky and uncomfortable. Bought for a client but she didn't care for it and now the window has closed already and I can't return it.,I would say it's good for stability but not for comfort. My knee gets sore from it. Its a choice between the pain from my knee problems or the pain from the brace.,This product does not meet my needs. It slides down my leg after repeated adjustments. It does not allow my skin to breathe. It's bulky.,Style/design did not work for me, but company quickly and kindly issued a full refund and sent my feedback to their development team for improvement of future products. Excellent customer service.,It’s decent. But the straps that wrap around itch and dig into the bare skin on the back of your leg. Needs to be solid in the back.,This would probably work amazing for a smaller person, but if you have larger thighs or calves its really uncomfortable...,Could have worn it over my pants, but it was still uncomfortable. It did help the pain, but not enough to keep it.,Very stiff. Not able to bend my knee at all which has made it worse. Haven't been able to use it. Waste of money."
"Not what i expected.  It could not go round my knees.  Just wasted money . Try to return it but had difficulty with dropping off.,Does not stay up very well and does not seem to help me knee at all.  In fact the times I have worn it my knee hurt worse.,Everybody says that this product is easy to use.,But it's a little difficult to wear and take off it lol,The qualify of this product is good and it works.,Good price  and no pain after wearing this brace.,Does not give me good support or compression around the knee in the areas I need it. Otherwise nicely made.,The support did not fit me well because it was not tight enough at the under knee area. The whole thing kept slipping down.,Straps are too long and rub on the back of the knees. More of a one size fits all. Not for smaller legs,It was very small and it didn’t stay in place. I returned it. Would probably work for a skinny woman.,I found this terribly uncomfortable so I returned it. To be fair my knee was quite swollen at the time.,Everyone is unique, and this brace did not support my patella as expected. It actually pulled the knee cap down and caused more pain. It’s been in my closet if anyone wants it.,Brace was too tight although it was measured and supposed to fit. Tightness made it impossible to put on without pain."
"Slides down, shifts a lot. If I tighten it, to keep it from slipping, it's too tight...,These are too bulky prevents knee movement :(,Also I didn’t feel too much support.,So sorry to say, I did not get the knee support I was in need of. I had to return for a refund.,Every thing is fine except so many scratchy parts. Hard to wear unless totally wrapped underneath and then why use this thing?,Great fitting and supporting brace,  but we're 6 months in and the velcro no longer stays. I'm super disappointed because I ordered 2 and now they need to be replaced.,This brace is so profoundly uncomfortable that I would sooner use a cheap bandage wrap rather than ever wear this again. I originally bought this for jogging and knee support for an old injury but I can barely even walk without the straps pinching the back of my leg. I regret spending any amount of money on this and recommend using literally anything else.,These braces are too big for a petite person. It is restrain your movements (perhaps because it,s big). I wish I could try them in a much smaller size. One size fits all is definitely not for me,This brace feels no different from the one I purchased at the Dollar store for one dollar.,No matter how I tried to apply this knee brace, it would slide down. I can't recommend this to anyone! Finally went out and bought an ace bandage. Problem solved.,This brace is terrible. It doesn't even go on like the picture. Very uncomfortable"
"I developed severe knee pain after using this on both my knees for a month. I use this while running to give my knees some kind of support. But this restricted my movement so much that I didn’t realize I was running criss-cross.,Very uncomfortable, bulky and non supportive, would not stay put. Returning,Not comfortable at all.  Supportive? Yes!  Wearable? Not for me!,Worked ok..slipped down my leg a lot. Helped protect my knee from further injury (mcl sprain).,For petite women, this does NOT work. It kept scrunching together. It was very uncomfortable durning movements. I could not run in it. What a waste!,Didn't stay up on my knee.  It pinched the back of my knee,I returned it cos I could not sit with my knee with it on,Didn't fit.,I was hoping this would stand up to high intensity workouts and really stabilize my knee. (I have issues with patella tracking). Unfortunate it didn't hold up.  It constantly slides and shifts and I'm always adjusting it.,This might be good if you're andre the giant... This is really big. one size fits most gigantors"
"Impossible to wear,Cumbersome and uncomfortable,I want to return this item because I thought it was two pieces, not one. This item is too padded / cushy for my intent, which is for knee support as I weight lift. I missed the return date and am trying to figure out what to do. Thanks.,This was no way near comfortable and way too bulky!,Way too small.  Did not meet sizing guidelines!,Supported fine but rubbed on the back of the knee, so uncomfortable had to remove it,The product is great. it holds the knee nicely, keeps everything stable and in place.,The problem is that it hurts.,as soon as you try to do sports with it and bend the knee, you get a horrible pinch at the back of the knee.,for use only for walking etc. NOT FOR SPORTS,This didn’t support and it was a little too flimsy,Don't buy unless you know you will keep them, you have to pay for return shipping and it's not cheap. The brace was very heavy, the cross straps in the back were uncomfortable, and it did not feel like it was secure on my knee the second I started to move.,I would give it five stars but the added support straps are fairly useless. They dont sit right and fall down when you're moving. Even if tightened down all the way.,Does a decent job of support but very uncomfortable after a few hours of wear. Especially behind the knee from the straps cutting into the skin."
"The product looks very nice but the design makes that the strap that you stretch around the knee creates a friction at the back of it against the skin. The pain of the burn was so bad, I had to take it out after just 20mn...,Won't stay on the knee keeps sliding down.,This product does provide support. Biggest issue is the straps that you wrap around your leg dig into the back of your leg. If you’re using for weight lifting, maybe consider something where the straps do not go diagonal across the back of your knee.,This may work well for people who need major support.  It is very well made.  However, I could barely move my knee with this on.  Very constricting.  Immobilizing more than supportive.,Can’t seem to get it to stay in place.,My last ones were stolen with my luggage, couldn't find the same thing again so bought this one.,It supports well, really good.,But I can't wear it for long as it is too heavy. The fabric is not so breathable so you have to take it down every 30 minutes or so or your knee feels funny.,This doesn't fit me properly. It's very tight in the thigh and bunching in the lower knee. I wish I hadn't missed the window to return it :( Not a great product for my needs. I would prefer a fitted, elastic type brace and will buy that next.,It’s not very good and it isn’t stable,This brace is SO bulky and uncomfortable you can't possibly use it for working out. I find that it even inhibits my ability to walk comfortably. I'll stick with my old, worn out brace over this one.,This brace was poorly put together. The cross straps covered the knee therefore not given me the proper support. Overall i gave 3 stars because the stability and range of motion when active is good."

Ordered largest available, no good.,Sorry I had to return these item as they didn’t fit.  I can’t say anything bad about this item it just didn’t work for me.,It kept coming down, doesn’t hold on place. Material quality was good. But since the main purpose of this supporter is to support it is not doing that.,Brace does not fit well so as a result it's very abrasive.  Ended up taking it off before work out.,These run small.,It was a lot of work putting it on.  Too many steps.  Too many straps.  I have thin legs and had it on the tightest settings, and it was bulky.  Hardly worth the effort to put it on.,It already ripped and only had for a few months"
"Ok support but very uncomfortable. I wrapped the straps in every way imaginable and could not get them to stop digging into the back of my knee.,Big and Bulky and unable to perform floor exercises while using it.,You would have to tighten this so much to stay in place. Then you lose circulation and then the discomfort.,Just kept falling down and i just walked slowly.,The knee brace does slide.  It looked big before I put it on and was a little worried.

I have stopped using it.,It was not for me,Concept of elastic crossover bands seems sound but I found these to be no better than other wraps I have purchased. However I did find them more difficult to apply and so I will not purchase these again when it is time to replace.,Did not fit unable to wear,Just got this one and put it to test right away.Used it on a like walking trail and had to keep adjusting several times as it was moving out of place. Also the Velcro roughed my tights which were my fav ones.,It gives good support but it gaps around the opening and I don’t like that as it prevents full support of my knee."

It did not help my knee, if anything it made it worse by causing it to hyperextend against the kneecap. The straps the wrap around just bunch up behind the knee and dig in.,Product is uncomfortable, binds behind the knee. Not bad when standing & still, but sitting & climbing stairs was horrible. Used it once.,Small,I did not like the product because it felt hurtful on my skin,It’s very scratchy and irritates my leg, I stopped wearing it to workout since I always wear shorts and the super wasn’t worth the irritation,Have it three stars for what I got it for.

"Rubbed the back of the leg. Felt very supportive but didn't end up wearing it.,Not a good brace for some one when has big thighs.

"They slip off,Good support while being lightweight. Great for about 4 weeks of daily wear and then the top velcro stopped holding.,My daughter did not like this brace. She said she couldn’t run while wearing it. It also came off during a game . Little flimsy,I bought two of these knee braces in May. They worked well for a few months but now the Velcro straps will not hold and these are practically useless. I guess they are not built for daily exercise.,It hurts my knee worse, might be how my sprain is but I had to stop wearing it because it was putting me in a lot of pain.,Good support but extremely bulky.,I bought this product because I had a knee injury. I thought it would help when I played golf. It didn’t seem to do anything. I am sorry I bought it.,Returned this item. It didn’t seem to fit right and was to bulky to wear.,Really good product at first but loosens after a month. Holds my knee together just wish it was more durable,The support and stability are really bad, if you have a torn ACL save your money and buy a hinged knee support"
"Straps around back of leg pinch during walking. Irritating back of knee and skin.

I was hoping the extra straps would help keep it from slipping but it doesn’t.,Does not give  me the support I need it might work for others but not for me"
"Does not hold up to active lifestyle. I wore it several times and it got stretched out very fast and harder to use and I had to replace it with a different type of Knee stabilizing device,It did not help my knee to stay in place for stability. Also it kept falling down and was bulky in jeans. Thank you,Not what I expected. Very soft on the support.,when you try to return you get wrong lable u p s will not pick up with printed return lable,Uncomfortable fit...velcro rubs the skin,UNCOMFORTABLE and bites/pinches the back of the leg-- would not buy again - there are better options that don't hurt,These are bulky and the Velcro straps pop open all of the time,The Velcro closure tabs weren't even sewn onto the product, but otherwise it seemed to be a decent product for the price.,The brace is too tight on the upper part and so uncomfortable it is not going to work for me,Brace ripped apart after a handful of times.

Velcro contact lacking strength so poor support.,Provides great support but amount of brace behind the knee results in limited motion.,It just didn’t give much support for me and it’s too bulky,Felt great on my knee but the velcro stopped working after only a few weeks. Not worth the money,It was just okay, and doesnt offer optimal flexibility & mobility,The only thing I don’t like about this brave is the Velcro is starting to give way and I haven’t had this brave very long.,The Velcro on the long strap completely just torn of now I can use the second strap because there is no way for to hold"
"Not suitable for my needs,Good support but the straps are very uncomfortable on the back of your knee when squatting,Ok,The knee support is good.

"The bomp show my on my pants,Sizing wrong,Too large. Doesn’t fit,To tight, makes leg swell,Did not fit],No complicated to put on simplify it,Its painful for me to stand up, my right knee is in constant pain, this product claimed to ease pain by supporting, the bars in this brace arent strong enough to support 1lb let alone my knee. The pain with or without this brace is the same, the only difference is how uncomfortable it feels and the amount it causes me to sweat. Junk product should be marketed for children, though i doubt its enough to even support a kids knee.,The brace is bulkier than I expected and also range of motion is not as broad as I had hoped.  It takes a bit of trial and error to figure out the right amount of tension to put on the straps to achieve proper support.  The brace does provide added support and helps in keeping my knee from over straining. The back of the knee ends up somewhat sore after a few hours of use as a result of the back of the straps rubbing against the back area of the knee. Also due to the bulk of the brace when in the sitting position there is noticeable pressure in the front and back knee area. Seems to be unavoidable as positioning the straps otherwise reduces the benefits of the support.  I have to say that despite the negatives at end of day my knee did feel better and the next day was not as sore as usually happens when I've done a lot of walking the previous day.  I plan to use the brace on days where I will be doing lots of walking but for times when I might be going to dinner or a show where sitting is involved I will likely use a brace with less bulk or a full knee sleeve.,The brace was working fine, however, just passed the 30-day Mark the side stabilizer pop through. It's aggravating, it happened just a couple days after the 30-day return window expired. Not happy at all. It does not get heavy use, but it does get used. I would have expected it to actually work for more than 30 days,Everyone is different and will need to find the right support that works for their particular case.  This brace did not work for me.  The best thing this brace did for me was to get me to look at knee muscular charts to pinpoint the right area that I need support for (hamstring).  Other then that, I found this brace allows more flex then I would have liked and the elastic bands cut and pinched the back of my knee.  I really couldn't tell that this brace restricted my movement at all so I think it's better for compression then support.  This brace simply introduced new types of pain and uncomfortable feelings in my case (thin legs).  On the pro side, the gel around the knee cap is nice and it did stay in place and appears to be well constructed for what it is."
"After reading the reviews I decided on this knee brace. I first tried it while resting with my leg up. I started getting severe pain above my knee where it’s not been painful. I couldn’t wear it for longer than five minutes. Today I decided to give it another try in my walk. I usually walk 5-10 miles a day but with this brace I didn’t make it three miles. The brace doesn’t allow my knee to bend so I walked with a limp and started feeling pain above my knee and into my thigh. It got so bad I had to remove the brace and I immediately felt better. I’m going to send it back.,I bought a pair of these about nine months ago to combat knee pain I was having. I have worn them two times a week on average for about an hour each time (bicycling and treadmill walking) since then. In the last several months I have noticed the velcro is actually losing its grip (stickiness). In fact they usually come undone while I am in the middle of a workout and will not stay fastened. The problem is happening with the wide straps that wrap around the leg (not the criss-cross straps). I thought these were pretty stable knee braces but it looks like I am going to have to replace them because they will not stay secured.,I have a box of assorted braces I have accumulated over the years. This is my least favorite. It does not seat easily where it belongs, which means you could actually do damage to your knee. And it is very uncomfortable because of the bulk. If you have to ever kneel at all while wearing a brace don't buy this one. It's painful because there is so much fabric/material behind your knee.  If we were not living in the times we were I would have returned this and gone to the store but will keep since I cannot go out.,Horribly uncomfortable. I tried adjusting the straps several ways and various degrees of tightness, but it was just so uncomfortable. It also didn’t feel very supportive and kept slipping down when I walked around. I tried tightening and adjusting the straps to stop the slipping, but that just made it even more uncomfortable. It felt pinchy behind my knee. I didn’t bother to try running in this brace. Wearing it around the house for 15 minutes told me everything I needed to know about this brace. I returned it without haste.,The size of the knee brace was twice the size of my leg. I assumed that it would be good for most sizes, but I was wrong. It may be great quality, but it certainly was not the right fit.,I wanted this to stabilize my knee while exercising and it does that; HOWEVER, I can’t do cool down or stretches because the straps across the back of the knee prevent the knee from bending at all.  I was using an older brace that had similar stabilization but was open in the crease of knee so motion was possible.  I guess I should have realized this before purchase, but am not sophisticated to make those kind of evaluations.  I am not comfortable wearing it during non-work out times, so it’s back to the sleeve.,I tried to love this. Ran with it twice and had to return it. It was difficult for me to strap it up, the picture makes it look easy, but maybe I'm not too bright. It scraped up the back of my knee and no matter how I adjusted it, I couldn't get it to feel comfortable. It was either too tight or when I thought it was just right, as I'd run, it would start to slide down. This may be right for others, but just didn't work for me.,Tried three different.This one,  ACE Compression Knee Brace LG (winner), Techwear Pro (same design as ACE but a little too tight). This brace was more rigid than I needed for now. I have a torn Meniscus, but not a very bad one. Second time, same knee. 5'11. 270 lbs.,I'm a 230# woman and this was quite difficult to put on as the part above the knee wasn't really big enough.  My leg is pretty big as I am overweight.  This makes it hard to pull the straps far enough over so that no velcro touches your leg.  Also, if you lack hand strength, it's hard to grab the tabs for putting on.  Then you need to hold them at the back of your leg, and if you have a hard time bending that far over, that adds another difficulty.  So I'm going to say that this is better for someone who doesn't have mobility issues or hand and arm strength issues.,There's certainly nothing wrong with it, for someone whose legs are smaller around and whose hands and arms are more fit.,Have used Mueller brand many times as well as Ace. Liked design of this Bodyprox so bought it. It has great features but not for me as to keep it in position over knee cap it has to be really tight to stay in place and is uncomfortably so. If i loosen it it wont stay in place no in between. Could just be me as one size may not work on me. Bodyprox has good reviews overall. I will likely return it as I cannot use it."
"I unfortunately bought this brace in hopes it would have more stabilizers on the sides (which is in the name of the product) and it doesn't have much stability.  I could still feel my knee give out when making lateral movements, which is what I was trying to avoid.  It's very easy to use and comfortable, but doesn't give extra stability, if that's your main focus on buying this product.,I like how it stabilizes my knee;I use it all day during work (standing). The bad thing is There seems to be an open gap in the back of my knee which pierces the skin and leaves groove marks and pain from pressing into the skin. I tried to wrap it different ways and it doesn’t seem to cover. It does it job stabilizing it though. If anyone reads this and has suggestions, I am open to it!,I ordered two braces, in different styles, which both arrived yesterday.  This one didn't seem right for me, but my husband liked it, so he's keeping it.  His knees are in better shape than mine.  The brace I liked is the hinged model by this same company (by the way, I just ordered a second one in that style).  This lighter brace would probably work fine for someone who doesn't need heavy duty support.,A number of years ago I tore the ACL in my knee and caused my leg to bow at the knee. The inside of knee is rubbing bone on bone. I had hoped this brace would alleviate some of the pain, but it did not. No matter how I adjusted the straps it only got worse. After trying to wear this brace for a week, I finally gave up. I would not recommend this knee brace. Sorry.,This brace was only so-so. It isn’t any better than an Ace brand one you can buy at the store. In fact, the straps that wrap around the back we’re actually quite uncomfortable when wearing it for long period of time. I didn’t wear it on bear skin, but over a pair of workout leggings and it still was uncomfortable. It might be fine for just a work out session, but not for all day wear.,I thought this product should solve the issue where I can control the support level of the brace based on the strap tightness. I tried so many times to follow the instruction, but no matter how I fixed the straps (tight or loose), it just did not provide any support. The worst of all, the straps left painful mark on upper and lower of my leg.,Bought for my 11 year old son after an injury at school, we were looking for something he can wear every day to school and found this. As it fits him and has room to grow, we found that only after 1 week of use the cross straps stretched out about an inch and then the velcro piece fell off. Looking closer at it, there are NO stitches hold those on, they are stamped/ stabbed through to create a grip. Luckily, I own a sewing machine and will be reattaching these.,This thing does not work! Do not buy! I bought one for each knee for extra support for work. They fall down constantly and are more of a pain to pull up then they add in support. It didn’t matter how tight I made the Velcro or what I wore under them or just had them against bare skin, they constantly slipped down.,I do not know how this thing got all the rave reviews. It is very flimsy and insubstantial.  The straps are weak, and wrap in an uncomfortable manner without much in the way of support.  It was so weak, in fact, that I would have a hard time considering it even a compression sleeve.  Completely useless for advertised purpose.,this did keep my knee supported however it did not allow for walking comfortably with it on.  I found that I could only use it while sleeping as it didn't stay in place very well when trying to walk with it on. I ended up purchasing a different style of compression knee support locally which is a better fit for my life style."
"I absolutely loved the brace but only after wearing it for about a week the velcro no longer holds to together anymore. When I go for my walks the velcro in the back of the legs seperate causing the knee brace to slide down my leg. I will try to return the item.,Bought to assist with knee cap tracking.  It offered no help.,The brace will not let you run in it. No matter how tight I put it. The brace still slipped down. Also I wore it with shorts on a five mile hike. The velco kept scratching me. I didnt think it was a big deal until later that day I noticed it had cut up my leg.,I've been using this since July 15th of 2019. It worked great to start with, kept my knee cap from moving around in the middle of the night just like I needed it to. After several months the top Velcro started popping open in the middle of the night and the brace would relocate and I'd wake up in pain. It's worse not to use it. Right now I'm taping it on, I'll be looking for new Velcro to replace it with. Worked great, just wish it would have lasted longer!,Supplys good support but slides right down leg when I walk no matter how I put it on or what sock I wear under it.,This is the second type of brace I have bought and they both did the same thing. Do not know the solution if there is one.,It's a great design, but the materials are sub par. It loosens up and slips. The worst part is the Velco which is weak. It ceased sticking properly after a week or so. Had to return. Disappointing as, like i said, the design is great.,I got these thinking they would ease my knee pain now that I’m getting into running again. They were so big and bulky and uncomfortable I couldn’t even walk with them. I’m amazed at all the great reviews. Sadly I returned these.,I've been wearing this brace and NEED it. The fasteners on the back of the brace stop sticking. It slides down my calf.,This brace did not help my knee at all.  It may just be the type of injury I have. I had a meniscus tear and surgery a few years ago.  An Ace bandage works better for me.  It is a substantial brace and very well made.,This product off-gasses SOMETHING. The smell is so strong that I haven't been able to wear it. The first two days it gave me headaches. I have it still in hopes the smell will go away, but so far, it still reeks like a chemical plant."
"Too small,This is an average-sized knee brace. It will not work for heavy people. That being said, it is a very nice brace.,The product may not be the right size for me but, when I wear it, it’s soft.  I  failed to look  at the size first Before buying. It’s my first time with a knee issue and thought it would fit. I think it’s a good product otherwise.,I found it to be bulky, and when I tightened it down so it would stay put it caused pressure pain in my calf, not sure if I will continue to use it , didn’t seem to stabilize my knee that much,An absolute waste. Can't wear it.,The velcro straps, when holding tight, cut on the back crease of the knee and hurts like hell.,When the straps are made somewhat looser the brace rotates and moves.,This brace is supportive and stays in place. However, the straps do cause a pinching of my skin behind the knee. Also I can only wear them over my clothes because of the bulky ness. Good for when I’m in yoga pants and staying around the house.,3 stars because it appears to be made well & of good material. However, ""one size fits most"" is only accurate if ""most"" are on the smaller size. I couldn't get it wrapped around my leg above the knee.,it was too warm, causing knee area to become damp and then brace slips down leg...…...it is just too big and bulky to wear under dress pants,Took this brace along with my old brace on vacation. While on vacation I find myself going back to my old brace for a better support. For me this one just did not give enough support no matter how tight I put it.,It didn't work for me.  It was very uncomfortable behind my knee.  I returned it.  If I had kept it, the back of my knee would have been rubbed raw.  I don't have skinny legs, but they are not huge either.  It might work better for small legs."
"Im a runner and I'm having problems with my knees. I bought the product and I try in many ways I can think and my knees hurt me more . I waist my money and my time,It is kinda bulky and fit was ok. It did slide around a lot and was a lot thicker then I thought it would be. Didnt feel like it helped a lot.... I found a better one ""techware pro"". Pullup sleeve that felt a lot better,I dont like this. I got it for an ltl issue, and it causes pain. Also, It looks too bulky for me. I have a feeling it would work better for a different type of knee problem area.,I guess I should have looked harder before I bought this.  I thought it would be made of a lighter weight fabric.  It feels like felted wool...not great for Florida weather.  And its bulky behind the knee.,This brace might work for some people, but for me the straps crossed right over the bottoms of my knee caps, putting too much pressure on them. I returned it.,Too tight and too loose. It cuts off the circulation and won’t stay up. Having Velcro on the top and bottom doesn’t work. Not good for playing basketball.,No support, may work for a banged up knee, that's all.,Started out great. Comfortable but velcro wore out in 3mths. I had to wear everyday for stability  so if you dont need to wezf it everyday it would be fine.,Rubbed my husbands knee.  Uncomfortable.  Couldn’t send back..no shipping label provided.  Threw out.  Wouldn’t recommend this product.,Did not feel good on my knee, it was smaller than expected and you don’t get good range of motion while exercising or even walking"
"After my broken patella, I tried several braces.  This did not hold my kneecap firm.  Tried to send back - missed the deadline in the Christmas rush,The only thing i do not like is the velcro straps that goes around the main leg are to short and are hard to get attached while putting on,Sorry to say I return the item after trying it on.  It didn't hold around my knee and kept on slipping down.  I didn't feel relief like it was advertised.,Good support but not comfortable directly against the skin. The straps are bulky. I'll keep it for future need but ordered something else more comfortable.,The elastic got uncomfortable around the back of the knee after a couple of hours.. other than that it was comfortable to wear,Tough to walk around with. Especially the material in the back of the knee pad... May be good for other people, just not for me...,If you don’t get straps lined up perfect, it gouges the back of the knee.  If you get the straps lined up perfectly the braces works great.,Purchased this because of the gell grip stated. Didn't help, still slides down my leg after 10 minutes of walking.,I ended up returning this. It was uncomfortable and seemed to need to be placed exactly right but once exercising would pinch a bit. Not great for me.,I liked this product online. However when it was purchased, it did not fit well for a short person. It was too bulky."
"The straps make the back very uncomfortable. It doesn’t feel like it ever sits in the right spots no matter how much I adjust it.,The criss cross design of the straps is not comfortable to wear. It's ok for support but just not great or comfortable. Wouldn't recommend it for anyone with knee problems.,Wasn't the most comfortable and kept sliding down my leg no matter how tight it was. I switched to a compression style.,It was more bulky than I thought, felt tight and restricting, and didn't go on well. Just not for me.,I washed this 5 or 6 times & aired it in the sun and in the breeze. Still stinks like the worst Chinese poison plastic even after 4 months.,I did not receive gel pads with my order. Also, I do not feel as much support as I had hoped.,too big to go under jeans and  I can't get it to go around my thigh so is made small in that respect.,cannot get the return label to print.,product rubbed on the side and back of the knee leaving sore spots after use,It slides down your knee and something in the back irritates the back of your knee wish I could send it back but my kids unfortunately threw the package away,Twisted my knee digging with a shovel in the garden. Now have sharp pain going down or up the spiral staircase and cannot use the elliptical for exercise. Thought this would give enough support to heal while still being active, but made no difference in the pain."
"Very uncomfortable behind the knee. So much, I'm not using it.,Would not stay on knee/  Slipped down almost immediately,Had to send it back, it wouldn't support my knee, ended up at my ankle.,Didn't help stabilize my knee unless it was so tight the pressure hurt my knee. Straps cover knee cap. Basically not worth the money.,Didnt fit right gave it to father was made well,RETURNED IT, IT WAS NOT QUITE WHAT I WAS NEEDING.,I guess my leg is too small. It bunches up and felt very bulky.,Just ok. Didn’t really help my knee for running on the treadmill.,Site says it fits up to 21.5 inches; it does not. Prior to purchase I measured my thigh to make sure. 21 inches. I would say that for it to fit properly and with no potential blood clotting or bruising 19 inches is about all it could be.,It fits the knee and chin but not above the knee"
"Didn't work for me.  Preferred a slip on,Did not provide the support I need Ed.,It was ok. Dig into the back of my leg.,Gel on knee padding makes it too heavy and rest of material too thick which doesn't allow good Range of motion,It’s too thick and restrictive,Very big and bulky, would not stay up,I would not recommend this product, the stiching on the inside of the brace chafes horribly.,Its to bulky for me to workout with. So l returned it,Uncomfortable when walking,It s not what I expected at all"
"Constantly slides,Way too small. Doesn't work for plus size.,Too bulky for a small knee,Too small.,Didn’t fix at all my leg isn’t that big,I'm very disappointed of this product. It's difficult to adjust and after a time the brace slip down.,This is bulky and doesn't quite give the support I was expecting, unfortunately.  It gives stability, but it doesn't stabilize the area (inside knee) that I need.,I bought this brace in November for my osteoarthritis.  It worked well in the beginning, but the velcro is not strong enough to hold and has already given out.,Cumbersome straps serve no purpose,At first it provided great support, but after only a few uses, the Velcro no longer sticks. The straps that wrap around will come loose in the middle of a run."
"Bulky, difficult to adjust for a good fit & did not support my knee as expected.  Much better success with the K tape,I don’t feel like these provide great support on my knee. The back of the wrap is uncomfortable when doing squats or lunges.,Purchased for my 13 year old with a 16 inch diameter thigh.  Too big.  Had to return it.,I did not like this. It was too bulky since I wanted to use it under my clothes,Not supportive, ace wrap would work better, don’t waste your money!,Does not stay in place for very long,Unfortunately this brace didn't work for me.
